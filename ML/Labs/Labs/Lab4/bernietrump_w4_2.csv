realDonaldTrump,Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). That’s why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November.

realDonaldTrump,"I agree with him on this, 100%. But why would anyone vote Democrat? We are setting all time records with the economy!"
BernieSanders,This is how our corrupt political system works: Dow Chemical gives $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee. In return Trump allows Dow Chemical to make huge profits off a dangerous chemical. We must put people over profits and end our corrupt campaign finance system.

BernieSanders,"Since I have been an elected official, I have used my influence to stand with those who have no power. That's what I do."

BernieSanders,"Just like Trump, the GOP in Arizona is demonizing immigrants and using hate to turn us against one another. We must stand together against racist legislation like SB1070. @LUCHA_AZ is organizing to fight back: http://bit.ly/sb1070plus https://nyti.ms/2SKDmwP"
realDonaldTrump,Thank you Steve!
BernieSanders,A truly beautiful moment from last night's roll call vote at the Democratic National Convention...
realDonaldTrump,“A Very Stable Genius!” Thank you.
BernieSanders,I agree with Cory Booker. This is especially true at a time when the Trump administration is trying to divide us up with its racist appeals.
realDonaldTrump,I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago. The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters....
realDonaldTrump,"WOW! Thank you, just landed, see everyone soon! #KAG2020 "
BernieSanders,"As a nation we must invest in education. We need to raise teacher pay to at least $60,000 a year. We need universal pre-K. We need to cancel student debt. We need to make public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free."
realDonaldTrump,"Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs. """"""""We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history."""""""""
realDonaldTrump,Address to the Nation Full Video & Transcript: https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/10159704959520725/
BernieSanders,I am delighted that @realDonaldTrump has agreed to debate. Let’s do it in the biggest stadium possible.
realDonaldTrump,"A beautiful evening in Phoenix, Arizona with Great American Patriots. THANK YOU!"
BernieSanders,"It is an absolute moral imperative that our response — as a government, as a society, as business communities, and as individuals — meets the enormity of this crisis. Read and watch my full remarks to the nation today:"
BernieSanders,This is absolutely barbaric. The cruelty and absurdity of our for-profit health care system is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been. We need Medicare for All.
BernieSanders,This is horrifying. @Uber has a responsibility to do more to protect its workers and passengers than issue a report and expect praise for transparency.
realDonaldTrump,"On this Vietnam War Veterans Day, we celebrate the brave Vietnam Veterans and all of America’s Veterans. Thank you for your service to our great Nation!"
BernieSanders,"Here's Trump's brilliant idea: tell Americans that we cannot guarantee health care for all to distract from the fact that he's the most corrupt president in our modern history. Another great idea from our """"""""stable genius"""""""" president."
realDonaldTrump,These flyers depict Australia’s policy on Illegal Immigration. Much can be learned!
realDonaldTrump,"Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: “This IG Report makes it clear, as did Rod Rosenstein’s memo, that Trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing Jim Comey. So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.” Witch Hunt!"
realDonaldTrump,Very good meetings with North Korea.
realDonaldTrump,"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!"
realDonaldTrump,Wonderful Church service at Camp David. Thank you!
realDonaldTrump,"Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes, there was no crime, the call with Ukraine was perfect, with “no pressure.” She said it must be “bipartisan..."
realDonaldTrump,The great Scam is being revealed!
BernieSanders,"This must be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the rationality of our current health care system, which exists to make corporations as much profit as possible, regardless of the consequences."
BernieSanders,"I stood with Immokalee farmworkers in 2008, fighting for better working conditions. I stand with them now. I say to @Wendys, join the @fairfoodprogram and protect workers from sexual violence and forced labor."
realDonaldTrump,"....we are going to have an Election very shortly.” Rep. Jeff Van Drew, Democrat of New Jersey. @foxandfriends Thank you. Just another Witch Hunt by Nancy Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats!"
realDonaldTrump,"The Republican Party will become the Party of Great HealthCare! ObamaCare is a disaster, far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high - virtually unusable! Moving forward in Courts and Legislatively!"
realDonaldTrump,Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?
BernieSanders,"""""""""A leader who understands the problems, has an indictment of the system and is willing to do what it takes to take on the interests that want to keep us down. That's Bernie, all day."""""""" –@iPhilSomething"
realDonaldTrump,"....”I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people.....” This, based on what I have seen, is their big point - and it is no point at a all (except for a big win for me!). The Democrats should apologize to the American people!"
BernieSanders,Make no mistake: the billionaire class does not want young and working people to vote.
realDonaldTrump,Republican Approval Rating = 95%. Thank you!
BernieSanders,"We need to elect all the progressives running in New York. I would like to offer endorsements to two candidates I have known for many years, and are leaders of the progressive movement in New York: @JumaaneWilliams for Lieutenant Governor and @ZephyrTeachout for Attorney General."
realDonaldTrump,""
BernieSanders,"President Trump’s """"""""dumb Southerner"""""""" comment is elitist, despicable, divisive and contemptuous. We cannot allow this administration to divide us up. We must stand together and build an America that works for all of us, not just the few."
BernieSanders,"Our job now is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels, not to produce more greenhouse gas emissions."
realDonaldTrump,"Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE"
BernieSanders,Joe Biden voted for NAFTA. He voted for PNTR with China. That is not the kind of record that will defeat Trump. Join us live now from our roundtable in Detroit with workers affected by these disastrous trade agreements:
realDonaldTrump,"If @MittRomney spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump, he could have won the race (maybe)!"
realDonaldTrump,""
BernieSanders,Let me say to the pharmaceutical industry: you can spend all the money you want on 30-second ads against us. You can do all the lying you want. But we are going to lower prescription drug costs in this country. You’re going to stop ripping off the American people.
realDonaldTrump,The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!
realDonaldTrump,"Last time I went to Davos, the Fake News said I should not go there. This year, because of the Shutdown, I decided not to go, and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!"
BernieSanders,Secretary DeVos has made it clear this administration works for the executives and shareholders of predatory for-profit colleges rather than with students and taxpayers.
realDonaldTrump,"Democrats, fix the laws. Don’t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!"
BernieSanders,I will never stop fighting for the working people of this country.
realDonaldTrump,"“Democrats are frantic to throw something else at the President. That’s why you saw those 81 subpoenas. It’s ridiculous. Just because your still upset over an election that happened 2 1/2 years ago, you should not be allowed to ruin people’s lives like this.” Lara Trump, @FoxNews"
realDonaldTrump,"The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump."
BernieSanders,We can't allow guns to fall into the hands of people who shouldn't have them and that includes those on the terror watch list.
realDonaldTrump,"....place in TRADE, it’s taking shape in Military Competition.” Johnathan Ward, author and China expert. We are winning, and we will win. They should not have broken the deal we had with them. Happy Birthday China!"
BernieSanders,"All over this country, Native Americans have suffered far too much, and for far too long. They deserve a voice."
BernieSanders,We must expose Donald Trump as the fraud and the liar that he is.
realDonaldTrump,""
BernieSanders,.@tomperriello is standing up to fossil fuel corporations in opposing two fracked gas pipelines that would cut across Virginia.
realDonaldTrump,"“Ax falls quickly at BuzzFeed and Huffpost!” Headline, New York Post. Fake News and bad journalism have caused a big downturn. Sadly, many others will follow. The people want the Truth!"
BernieSanders,"""""""""Clinton acknowledged that, in some cases, a child’s deportation could bring them great harm."""""""" http://fusion.net/story/6173/hillary-clinton-backs-refugee-screening-abroad-for-central-american-kids/ #DemDebate"
realDonaldTrump,"Despite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of American politics, the Trump Administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other Administration. Judges, biggest Tax & Regulation Cuts, V.A. Choice, Best Economy, Lowest Unemployment & much more!"
BernieSanders,We need to re-enfranchise the more than 5 million Americans who have had their right to vote taken away by a felony conviction.
BernieSanders,We're with you Ady. We need Medicare for All NOW! #DemDebate2
BernieSanders,"In the richest country in the history of the world, seniors should not be choosing between food and medicine."
BernieSanders,Medical debt does not exist in other major countries. When I am president it won't exist in the U.S. either.
realDonaldTrump,"Today, it was my honor to welcome President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the @WhiteHouse!"
BernieSanders,"This family was able to save $10,000 buying insulin for their son in Canada, where the exact same insulin is one-tenth the price. The profits the drug companies are making ripping off the American people is scandalous, it is outrageous and it has got to end."
BernieSanders,Congratulations to newly elected @ATUComm President John Costa — a true rank and file leader with nearly two decades of experience and a commitment to transportation workers and riders.
realDonaldTrump,"....for Otto’s mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!"
BernieSanders,We deserve better than to be ripped off by Big Pharma. I urge Clinton and Trump to join me and support Californians. https://berniesanders.com/sanders-challenges-clinton-trump-back-california-drug-price-proposition/
realDonaldTrump,Great reviews on the new USMCA. Thank you! Mexico and Canada will be wonderful partners in Trade (and more) long into the future.
BernieSanders,These attacks continue a cycle of violence that must come to an end and those responsible must face justice.
realDonaldTrump,"This is what a future State of Palestine can look like, with a capital in parts of East Jerusalem."
BernieSanders,"It is absurd that in the richest country in the world, people with insurance still have to spend $20,000 out of their own pocket to defeat cancer. We need to pass Medicare for All."
realDonaldTrump,"The just revealed FBI Agent Lisa Page transcripts make the Obama Justice Department look exactly like it was, a broken and corrupt machine. Hopefully, justice will finally be served. Much more to come!"
realDonaldTrump,"...And this despite Fake Witch Hunts, the Mueller Scam, the Impeachment Hoax etc. With our Economy, Jobs, Military, Vets, 2A & more, I would be at 70%. Oh well, what can you do?"
realDonaldTrump,No surprise!
realDonaldTrump,"Thank you Iowa, I love you!"

BernieSanders,"Thank you to Virginians for making history by standing up for health care, gun safety and voting rights, and for sending a clear message to Trump that we reject his hate and bigotry."
BernieSanders,We can't have a safe & sound financial system if the same agencies rating Wall Street's products are making their profits from Wall Street.
realDonaldTrump,"Nancy Pelosi’s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast - she has lost total control and, along with her equally incompetent governor, Gavin Newsom, it is a very sad sight!"

realDonaldTrump,Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts.....
realDonaldTrump,"....ever. Had to rebuild our military, which was totally depleted. Fed Rate UP, taxes and regulations WAY DOWN. If Dems won in 2016, the USA would be in big economic (Depression?) & military trouble right now. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"
BernieSanders,Americans are working longer hours for lower wages and wondering how they're going to retire with dignity. This shouldn’t happen in America.

BernieSanders,"When we all stand together, there is nothing, nothing that we cannot accomplish."
realDonaldTrump,The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as “Mr. Magoo” and Rod Rosenstein as “Mr. Peepers.” This is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” There are no such people and don’t know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will!
realDonaldTrump,"Kevin Corke, @FoxNews “Don’t forget, Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....” Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!"

BernieSanders,"We must ensure that progress does not end on the platform's pages, but becomes reality. The fight is just beginning."

BernieSanders,Today has the potential to be a historic day. The House will vote on our War Powers Resolution to end the United States' unconstitutional support for the catastrophic war in Yemen. We must send a message to Trump: it's Congress—not the President—who has the power to declare war.

realDonaldTrump,#NeverForget #September11th
BernieSanders,Here’s the bottom line: the taxpayers of this country should not have to subsidize employees at a company owned by Mr. Bezos who is worth $155 billion. That's absurd and it’s going to end. On September 5th I am introducing legislation to do exactly that.

BernieSanders,West Virginia: tomorrow is your turn to vote for the political revolution. Make a plan to get to your polling place: https://vote.berniesanders.com/WV/
BernieSanders,"It's not enough to defeat Trump. We need to pass a Green New Deal, create 20 million jobs and save the planet. Donate any amount now and get our new Green New Deal sticker, and tune in to Bernie's Climate Town Hall on CNN tonight at 8:40 pm ET:"
BernieSanders,It's beyond belief that any serious candidate would support huge tax breaks for the top 1% while cutting services to working families.
realDonaldTrump,"Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!"
BernieSanders,"As 2015 comes to an end, my family, staff and I want to take an opportunity to wish our friends a #HappyNewYear."
BernieSanders,We are building together is a political revolution that will bring tens of millions of people together. Join us:
realDonaldTrump,...(Democrats said I never met) and released the military aid to Ukraine without any conditions or investigations - and far ahead of schedule. I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration.
realDonaldTrump,"Representative Randy Weber (@TxRandy14) of Texas has been a HUGE supporter of our #MAGA Agenda from the very beginning. Strong on Crime, the Border, Illegal Immigration, the 2nd Amendment, and our great Military &amp; Vets! Randy has my Full Endorsement!"
realDonaldTrump,"BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL! This is the new theme, for two years until the Wall is finished (under construction now), of the Republican Party. Use it and pray!"
realDonaldTrump,"Looking forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks, in North Carolina. His opponent believes in Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities, and won’t protect your Second Amendment! https://www.donaldjtrump.com/events/sep-noca-2019/"
BernieSanders,"Do some arithmetic. Imagine you are a senior. How do you pay for the food, the medicine, and heat you need on $13,000 a year? #BernieAtGU"
realDonaldTrump,"How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?"
realDonaldTrump,""
realDonaldTrump,Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain said NO PRESSURE.
BernieSanders,Ours is the only health care plan that would provide care for all Americans regardless of income. We can't leave 29 million uninsured.
realDonaldTrump,"Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs."
realDonaldTrump,"Thanks to “Phantom Fireworks” and “Fireworks by Grucci"""""""" for their generosity in donating the biggest fireworks show Washington D.C. has ever seen. CEO's Bruce Zoldan and Phil Grucci are helping to make this the greatest 4th of July celebration in our Nations history!"
BernieSanders,"Massive corporations like Smithfield Foods and Tyson drive family farmers off their land, abuse animals and destroy the environment. It is time to break up these agribusiness monopolies."
BernieSanders,We need to create a Democratic Party which fights for working families and not just wealthy campaign contributors.
BernieSanders,"Democracy is not a complicated process. It is one person, one vote. Not billionaires buying elections."
realDonaldTrump,Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our country’s history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW!
realDonaldTrump,"Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas is so popular in his District, and far beyond, that he doesn’t need any help - but I am giving it to him anyway. He is a great guy and the absolute “King” of Cutting Taxes. Highly respected by all, he loves his State & Country. Strong Endorsement!"
BernieSanders,"The political revolution is alive and well in Las Vegas. Thank you to the thousands of people who joined me, @AOC, @CarmenYulinCruz, @MoTownPhenom and more at our rally last night. We are going to win and build a nation based on justice in all its forms."
realDonaldTrump,"Also, tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective, and bringing them to a very high standard!"
BernieSanders,"We do not need a “tough"""""""" foreign policy, we need a smart foreign policy. #nhpolitics https://www.pscp.tv/w/1MYxNWVyawQKw"
BernieSanders,Wall Street bankers made more in bonuses last year than 3x the earnings of ALL full-time workers making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. We don’t need austerity for working families. We need austerity for the 1% and multinational corporations.
realDonaldTrump,"....that the House Democrats have done since she’s become Speaker, other than chase Donald Trump.” This Impeachment Hoax is such a bad precedent and sooo bad for our Country!"
realDonaldTrump,"Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T. As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN, perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible “anchors.” Also, I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune....."
realDonaldTrump,Happy 71st Birthday to our GREAT United States Air Force!
BernieSanders,The political revolution continues. Join us on Thursday to discuss what's next: https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/live?source=fbtwrd160615
BernieSanders,I fought to improve and pass Obamacare. I traveled all over the country to fight the repeal of Obamacare. But I will not be deterred from ending the corporate greed that creates dysfunction in our health care system. We must pass Medicare for All.
BernieSanders,Universal health care and tuition-free college aren’t radical. They already exist in other nations. Here’s what’s radical: Allowing giant corporations like Amazon to pay nothing in federal income taxes and giving fossil fuel companies billions in subsidies to destroy the planet.
realDonaldTrump,"....our manufacturers. We should have lower interest rates than Germany, Japan and all others. We are now, by far, the biggest and strongest Country, but the Fed puts us at a competitive disadvantage. China is not our problem, the Federal Reserve is! We will win anyway."
BernieSanders,"The Waltons of @Walmart are the richest family in America, worth $171 billion. They own more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans. Since 1982, the Walton family has seen its net worth increase by about 10,000%. They must pay their workers a living wage. #BernieAtWalmart"
BernieSanders,Today is your last chance to register to vote by mail in California! Get your ballot at home by registering at http://registertovote.ca.gov. The easiest way to support our campaign is to register as a Democrat.
realDonaldTrump,Fantastic being in the Great State of Kentucky last night. Vote for Matt Bevin NOW! @MattBevin One of Best Governors in U.S. He will never let you down!
realDonaldTrump,The Wall is being rapidly built! The Economy is GREAT! Our Country is Respected again!
realDonaldTrump,"The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!"
BernieSanders,"My condolences go out to the members of @CWAUnion for the passing of their former President, Morty Bahr. He helped lead efforts against privatization, deregulation and rising inequality. Today, we owe it to Morty to continue the fight to grow the trade union movement. #CWAstrong"
realDonaldTrump,"The Great State of Tennessee is so close to passing School Choice. All of our Nation’s children, regardless of background, deserve a shot at achieving the American Dream! Time to get this done, so important!"
realDonaldTrump,We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!
realDonaldTrump,"Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a truly fine gentleman!"
BernieSanders,"We need a president who will treat soaring drug costs as the national emergency it is—unlike Trump, who continues to let drug companies' greed kill Americans. When we are in the White House we will lower prescription drug prices by half."
realDonaldTrump,"Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!...."
realDonaldTrump,"Hard to believe that @FoxNews is wasting airtime on Mayor Pete, as Chris Wallace likes to call him. Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems. They got dumped from the Democrats boring debates, and they just want in. They forgot the people....."
BernieSanders,"We've got to fight for trade agreements that protect the interests of American workers, not just large corporations."
realDonaldTrump,"""""""""NEW EXTREME DEMS NOW RUNNING THE PARTY!"""""""""
BernieSanders,"If we are going to turn this country around politically, we need to do well in states like Pennsylvania."
realDonaldTrump,#PledgeToAmericasWorkers
BernieSanders,"I stand in solidarity w/ @UTLAnow teachers in their fight for fair pay, smaller classroom sizes &amp; stipends for materials and supplies. Teaching is one of the most valuable and indispensable professions. We need to treat educators with respect and dignity."
BernieSanders,Bernie has a message for Wall Street. Watch it live from New York now: http://BernieSanders.com/Live #BreakEmUp
realDonaldTrump,"Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the “Special” Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!"
realDonaldTrump,"John Kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country!"
realDonaldTrump,Congratulations to Mariano Rivera on unanimously being elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame! Not only a great player but a great person. I am thankful for Mariano’s support of the Opioid Drug Abuse Commission and @FitnessGov. #EnterSandman #HOF2019
BernieSanders,"The decision to have an abortion is a right of any woman, without interference from politicians. #InternationalWomensDay"
BernieSanders,Some people say it doesn’t matter where a campaign gets its money from. Of course it matters! We are not funded by billionaires and corporate CEOs. We are fueled by the working class.
realDonaldTrump,Thank you @foxandfriends. Really great job and show!
realDonaldTrump,Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!
realDonaldTrump,Thank you!

realDonaldTrump,Russia wants him to win!
realDonaldTrump,A team of great champions!
BernieSanders,There is simply no question as to whose side the Trump administration is really on. Not the working class. Just the ruling class.
BernieSanders,Fraud is the business model on Wall Street.
BernieSanders,The fracking industry admits what we already knew. Fracking hurts poor communities. We must ban fracking.
BernieSanders,The reality is there is one major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people: the United States. #DemDebate
BernieSanders,"Nurses and staff at Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo should not be working 20-hour shifts without decent health insurance, while the CEO of Mercy Health makes $1.7 million. @UAW nurses and staff in Toledo deserve fair pay, health care and work schedules."
realDonaldTrump,"Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?"
BernieSanders,We are going to take on the billionaire class and transform this country so it works for everyone not just the 1%.
realDonaldTrump,"DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!"
BernieSanders,What I saw at the US-Mexico border was the fact that you've got children on one side and their mothers on the other. That's wrong.
BernieSanders,We are going to defeat Donald Trump (and beat him badly) because we are going to expose him as a fraud and a phony. #DemDebate
BernieSanders,America's veterinary hospitals should uplift the dignity and well-being of their workers. I call on @VCAPetHealth to listen to the needs of its employees in CA and settle a strong and fair contract with the #VCAunion.
realDonaldTrump,HAPPY BIRTHDAY @USCG!
realDonaldTrump,"Great meetings at the @G7 in Biarritz, France! #G7Biarritz"
realDonaldTrump,"Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists......"

realDonaldTrump,"Thank you @GovBillLee and @MariaLeeTN. My Administration will always be there for the Great People of Tennessee. Together, we will prevail! https://twitter.com/MariaLeeTN/status/1236052152398876672"
realDonaldTrump,"I agree getting Tax Cuts approved is important (we will also get HealthCare), but perhaps no Administration has done more in its first....."
BernieSanders,"Thank you @ChokweALumumba for hosting a great town hall last night. We can, we must and we shall overcome the forces of greed and injustice that are holding us back."
BernieSanders,"If we stand together on Monday night, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. #NotMeUs #CaucusForBernie: http://bernie.to/CaucusForBernie"
BernieSanders,The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end. Atatiana Jefferson should be alive. The Department of Justice must investigate this.
BernieSanders,Young people are showing the courage to lead the fight against a climate disaster when many of our leaders won’t lift a finger. They do not deserve to be arrested – they deserve to be applauded and heard.
realDonaldTrump,"Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They don’t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work."
realDonaldTrump,"“John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. Not only is he a liar, he’s a liar about being a liar.” Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends"
BernieSanders,We must work toward making health care a right. But right now our job is to save our current system which Republicans are trying to destroy.
BernieSanders,New York — It's your turn to vote for our political revolution. Grab your friends and family and go out and vote. Polls close at 9 PM.
BernieSanders,I say to Donald Trump: instead of giving speeches about trade why don't you lead by example and make your goods in America.
realDonaldTrump,"Big Rally tonight in West Virginia. Patrick Morrisey is running a GREAT race for U.S. Senate. I have done so much for West Virginia, against all odds, and having Patrick, a real fighter, by my side, would make things so much easier. See you later. CLEAN COAL!!!!"
BernieSanders,"""""""""[Bernie] is not running as a politician. He's running as one leading a movement."""""""" -Rev. Al Sharpton"
BernieSanders,"Let me be clear: we have a misogynist in the White House who uses sexism for his own political purposes. Together, we are building a movement to bring people together, to end violence against women, and to fight for the fundamental rights of all women."
realDonaldTrump,"Heritage Foundation “These numbers are blockbusters. Just since Donald Trump took office, Median Family Incomrs are up over $4,100. In 8 years under President Obama, they only went up $1000. In one third the time, President Trump has increased incomes 4 times as much, and that..."

BernieSanders,"If you are asking me, do I think we should demand the wealthiest start paying their fair share of taxes, so we can have a government and a nation that work for all of us? Then yes. That is exactly what I believe. #DemDebate"
BernieSanders,".@chesaboudin knows that under our constitution, everyone is guaranteed equal justice under the law, not just the very rich and powerful."
realDonaldTrump,"Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!"
BernieSanders,Tonight at the Democratic National Convention I'll address the future of our movement. Will you watch? #DemsInPhilly
BernieSanders,"The “Partnership for America’s Health Care Future"""""""" is running large ad campaigns against Medicare for All. So who do they represent? The insurance companies and drug companies. If we are going to win the fight for Medicare for All, I need your help."
BernieSanders,"In many states, it is legal to fire someone for being gay or to deny someone housing for being transgender. That must change."

realDonaldTrump,I encourage everyone in the path of #HurricaneHarvey to heed the advice &amp; orders of their local and state officials.

realDonaldTrump,“It seems that the Brits and the French and the Germans are coming around to the idea that the Iranians are up to no good!” @BillHemmer @FoxNews
BernieSanders,"The Trump administration’s policy to separate families is a moral stain on our democracy and Trump must be stopped from making the situation even worse. These families must be reunited immediately, and separations at the border permanently stopped."
BernieSanders,"The War on Drugs has been a disaster. We need to legalize marijuana nationwide, invest in the communities that have been destroyed by its criminalization, and expunge past marijuana-related convictions."
realDonaldTrump,Why should I be defending a fraudulent Russian Witch Hunt. It’s about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the American People start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts. How and why did this terrible event begin? Never Forget!
realDonaldTrump,"....President who is willing to have the battle, and we have a great Attorney General who is willing to lead the battle, and they are going to get to the bottom of it.” @EdRollins @LouDobbs"

BernieSanders,"Spending a day walking in parades, meeting with volunteers, speaking to supporters and Vermonters, and enjoying the beautiful Vermont weather was a great pleasure. I look forward to many more like it this summer."
realDonaldTrump,"I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is “chaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.” The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, there’s almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and..."

realDonaldTrump,"Isn’t it amazing that the people who were closest to me, by far, and knew the Campaign better than anyone, were never even called to testify before Mueller. The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say ‘NO COLLUSION’ and only very good things!"

realDonaldTrump,"OK, so after two years of hard work and each party trying their best to make the other party look as bad as possible, it’s time to get back to business. The Mueller Report strongly stated that there was No Collusion with Russia (of course) and, in fact, they were rebuffed....."

realDonaldTrump,A PERFECT phone call. “Can you do us (not me. Us is referring to our Country) a favor.” Then go on to talk about “Country” and “U.S. Attorney General.” The Impeachment Hoax is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which has been going on for 3 years. We will win! #MAGAKAG #2020

BernieSanders,This decision ensures that big corporations will not be able to put a price tag on the free flow of ideas.
BernieSanders,"Let me make a prediction. When he begins his re-election campaign tonight, Trump won't mention that he tried to throw 32 million off health care, or that he proposed massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid & Social Security, or that he gave huge tax breaks to the top 1%. Just a guess."

realDonaldTrump,"We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-Tariffed countries..."

realDonaldTrump,"Great writer and historian, Doug Wead, has written a true (not Fake News) account of what is going on in Washington and the White House. His new book, INSIDE TRUMP’S WHITE HOUSE, is an incredible description of a very exciting and successful time in our Country’s history. Buy it!"
realDonaldTrump,"....WILL NEVER BE PROVEN AND ARE LIKELY FALSE.” Thank you to Michael Isikoff, Yahoo, for honesty. What this means is that the FISA WARRANTS and the whole Russian Witch Hunt is a Fraud and a Hoax which should be ended immediately. Also, it was paid for by Crooked Hillary & DNC!"

BernieSanders,There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.

realDonaldTrump,"Rachel Campos-Duffy has written a wonderful book for children, “Paloma Wants To Be Lady Freedom.” She and her husband, Sean Duffy, have done so much for our Country. Buy this book - great for the kids!"
BernieSanders,No one should go bankrupt due to medical bills. No one should avoid a doctor because they can't afford it. No one should watch a loved one die because they were uninsured. We must end this injustice and pass Medicare for All.
BernieSanders,"I grew up in a family that struggled financially, but I was able to attend an excellent public college which at that time was virtually tuition-free. We are going to once again make higher education a right for all, not a privilege for the few."

BernieSanders,We live in a world in which three billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of our entire country. I don't think that is the world we should be living in.
realDonaldTrump,"Spreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier “is unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.” Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel. He had far worse “stains” than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!"

BernieSanders,Democratic socialism means that we cannot allow the greed of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our environment and our planet. #BernieAtGU
BernieSanders,"For a limited time only, we are offering our first, official Bernie 2020 campaign sticker for FREE. Get yours before they’re gone."
BernieSanders,"Let me say this to the president: I am a proud Jewish person and I have no concerns about voting Democratic. And in fact, I intend to vote for a Jewish man to become the next president of the United States."
BernieSanders,"When we are in the White House, we will enact a federal jobs guarantee, to ensure that everyone is guaranteed a stable job. Between transforming our energy system and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, there is more than enough work to be done. Let's do it."
BernieSanders,"Political and media elites might write off our campaign. That's fine. We have more individual contributions than any campaign at this point in history, from working people everywhere. And we're going to win."
realDonaldTrump,My two great friends. Proud of you both!

BernieSanders,"Here are the cold hard facts of what will happen when we pass The Green New Deal and Medicare for All. We will: - Save the planet - Create 20 million jobs - Guarantee health care for all without copays, deductibles or premiums - End the greed of drug and insurance companies"
BernieSanders,Corporate-run health insurance isn't about saving lives. It's about making as much money as possible. With Medicare for All we can finally put an end to this international disgrace.
realDonaldTrump,"I will be in Louisiana tonight (Love it!) to get Republicans to vote for either of our two great Republican Candidates and force a run off with John Bel Edwards, who has done a really poor job of tax cutting, car insurance cost (worst in USA), & is suspect on your 2nd Amendment!"

BernieSanders,"Sean is absolutely right. Closing down Minor League teams, like the Vermont Lake Monsters, would be a disaster for baseball fans, workers, and communities across the country. We must protect these teams from corporate greed."
realDonaldTrump,"I am at Camp David working on many things, including Iran! We have a great Economy, Tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge Dollars coming IN, & on helping to make good Trade Deals. The Dow heading to BEST June in 80 years! Stock Market BEST June in 50 years!"

realDonaldTrump,Great day for Tax Cuts and the Republican Party. But the biggest Winner will be our great Country!
BernieSanders,One out of every three senior citizens in America relies on Social Security for virtually ALL of their income. I don't think the wealthiest country in history should have seniors living in poverty. Trump wants to slash Social Security. I believe we must expand it.
realDonaldTrump,Two incredible people. I can’t believe they’re not working (few work harder)!
BernieSanders,"We must stop the movement toward oligarchy and fight for an economy which works for all, not just the 1%."

BernieSanders,"We must fundamentally rewrite our trade policy so that American products, not American jobs, are our No. 1 export."
realDonaldTrump,"39% of my nominations, including Diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate, it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!"
BernieSanders,Happy birthday @iamcardib! I'm so glad to have you in the fight to defeat Donald Trump and get millions of young people involved in the political process.
realDonaldTrump,Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? Why aren’t these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?
BernieSanders,Our movement is about creating an America that ensures nobody working 40 hours a week has to live in poverty.
realDonaldTrump,Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!

realDonaldTrump,.@BrucePoliquin from Maine is a great Congressman. He is in a tough fight against a very liberal Nancy Pelosi Democrat. Bruce has helped bring JOBS back to his State and totally protects your Great Second Amendment. We need to keep Bruce in Washington. He has my Full Endorsement!
BernieSanders,Today LGBTQ people are more than 4.5% of our population but only hold 0.1% of elected offices. We must support the LGBTQ community in achieving the representation they deserve. Consider a run or nominate your friends at http://outtowin.org. #OutToWin
BernieSanders,"I urge you all to never underestimate the value of your voice, the power of your vote, and the potential that comes from people organizing around issues they care deeply about. What seems impossible can be made possible when millions of people stand united."
BernieSanders,"We are seeing progressive ideas that a few years ago were considered to be radical and extreme and fringe, suddenly becoming mainstream - because working people from coast to coast are standing up and fighting for them."
BernieSanders,"Parents should not have to sell their house or declare bankruptcy to keep their child alive. Under Medicare for All, if your child is sick, you don't have to worry if you can afford for them to see a pediatrician. They will get the care they need, regardless of your income."
BernieSanders,"The Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. If that ain't rigged, I don't know what is."
realDonaldTrump,"At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border. If not, Deportations start!"

BernieSanders,Thank you for your work @MaketheRoadAct!
realDonaldTrump,"“Our own Benjamin Hall is doing fantastic reporting on ISIS right on the from line (True). ISIS was willing to die but now, because of big pressure, save for a few people in caves, most have surrendered. A testament to our President.” Thank you Pete Hegseth @foxandfriends"

realDonaldTrump,"Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!"
realDonaldTrump,"After a wonderful dinner at the @USTreasury last night with the Amir of Qatar, @TamimBinHamad, it was my great honor to welcome him to the @WhiteHouse this afternoon!"
realDonaldTrump,"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!"
realDonaldTrump,"....And remember, a bank that I did use years ago, the now badly written about and maligned Deutsche Bank, was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world! They wanted my business, and so did many others!"
BernieSanders,"All across the country today, airline catering workers will be protesting unfair wages at @AmericanAir, @Delta and @United. I joined these @UNITEHERE members on the picket line last summer and proudly stand with them again today."

BernieSanders,".@cenkuygur has been a longtime fighter against corruption. However, our movement is bigger than any one person. I hear my supporters who were frustrated and understand their concerns. Cenk today said he is rejecting all endorsements for his campaign and I retract my endorsement."
realDonaldTrump,"JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low. Together, we are making the economy great again!"
BernieSanders,"No one can deny that today’s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is nothing more than a starvation wage. After 10 years of inaction, it’s time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Doing so would directly benefit over 41 million workers across the nation."
BernieSanders,"I don't want to live in a country where seniors are trying to live on $10,000 a year, where we have veterans sleeping out on the streets."
realDonaldTrump,"MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from El Salvador, and through Mexico, like water. El Salvador just takes our money, and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall!"
realDonaldTrump,"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!"

realDonaldTrump,"We are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA!"
realDonaldTrump,"The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling, Dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall."
realDonaldTrump,So funny to watch Schumer groveling. He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM!
realDonaldTrump,I agree with Joe!
realDonaldTrump,"Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D."
realDonaldTrump,""
realDonaldTrump,"Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous......"
realDonaldTrump,"Wacky Nut Job @AnnCoulter, who still hasn’t figured out that, despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight), I am winning on the Border. Major sections of Wall are being built..."

BernieSanders,"If you sit this election out and Trump wins by a few votes, many people are going to be dealing with that reality for their entire lives."
BernieSanders,Every other major country has made health care a right for all. Anyone who says the United States cannot do the same is selling the American people short. #MedicareForAll
realDonaldTrump,It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
BernieSanders,"In a nation which has far too much violence and murder, we’re going to end capital punishment."
realDonaldTrump,"New Strzok-Page texts reveal “Media Leak Strategy.” @FoxNews So terrible, and NOTHING is being done at DOJ or FBI - but the world is watching, and they get it completely."

realDonaldTrump,"Shifty Schiff now seems to think they don’t need the Whistleblower, who started the whole Scam. The reason is that the Whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the Transcript. Also, the second Whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!"
realDonaldTrump,"...What took place was completely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. Bill de Blasio should act immediately!"

realDonaldTrump,"In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!"
realDonaldTrump,"..TV talent. Then, during the 2016 Election, I would watch as Joe Scarborough & his very angry Psycho wife(?) would push Donny to the point of total humiliation. He would never fight back because he wanted to stay on TV, even on a very low rated show, all in the name of ambition!"
realDonaldTrump,"....out, and he’s been amazing at it. The Democrsts have no message, they have no hope for 2020.” @RepDougCollins @foxandfriends Thank you Doug!"

BernieSanders,It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues. That’s what this campaign and what democracy is about.
BernieSanders,"The fossil fuel companies lied to us about climate change for decades, and they are not going to help us solve our climate crisis now. We are going to save this planet by taking them on and building an unprecedented movement for a Green New Deal."

realDonaldTrump,"....our great police are being disrespected, even with water dumped on them, because a Mayor and Governor just don’t “have their backs.” New York’s Finest must be cherished, respected and loved. Too many prople are leaving our special New York. Great leaders would work...."
BernieSanders,"The right to vote is at the heart of freedom and equality in America, and the effort to suppress it must be met by fierce resistance."
realDonaldTrump,"....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!"

realDonaldTrump,It was my honor. THANK YOU!
realDonaldTrump,"As your President, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not! The Fed’s high interest rate level, in comparison to other countries, is keeping the dollar high, making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like Caterpillar, Boeing,....."

realDonaldTrump,"Another big dropout of the Presidential race was, along with 0% Tim Ryan, 0% @RepSwalwell. Such talk and bravado from both, and nothing to show. They stood for nothing, and the voters couldn’t stand by them. Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!"

realDonaldTrump,Great job by the U.S. Coast Guard!

realDonaldTrump,"....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
BernieSanders,"We have got to rally millions of people to stand together, to say, """"""""We are not going to deport millions of Latinos from this country."""""""""

BernieSanders,It’s laughable that Trump now says he’s going to turn the GOP into a “worker’s party.” How about you start by not trying to rip them off?
realDonaldTrump,"I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. Many stories & reports a pure fiction!"
BernieSanders,Bernie visited the site where President Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous address in 1863. http://bernie.to/OfThePeople

realDonaldTrump,"If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that President Trump “ignored early warnings about the threat,” then why did Media & Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said “early & not necessary.” Corrupt Media!"
BernieSanders,Innovation and business success should be rewarded. But greed for the sake of greed is not something that public policy should support.
BernieSanders,"Apple's earnings in 2015 were the highest reported of any corporation in history, yet apparently that wasn't enough."

realDonaldTrump,"Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?"
realDonaldTrump,".@FoxNews is at it again. So different from what they used to be during the 2016 Primaries, &amp; before - Proud Warriors! Now new Fox Polls, which have always been terrible to me (they had me losing BIG to Crooked Hillary), have me down to Sleepy Joe. Even considering....."
realDonaldTrump,Maria & John understood the dishonesty & deception from the very beginning!
BernieSanders,The federal government electrified America as part of the New Deal. We put people on the moon 50 years ago. We can sure as hell transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to 100% renewables today.

realDonaldTrump,"I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!"
realDonaldTrump,"The Fake News Media wants to stay as far away as possible from the Ukraine and China deals made by the Bidens. A Corrupt Media is so bad for our Country! In actuality, the Media may be even more Corrupt than the Bidens, which is hard to do!"
BernieSanders,"In recent years, we have seen abhorrent human rights abuses by the Philippine government. This repression of trade unionists is a shameful attempt to silence people's rights and freedoms. More than ever, we must stand on the side of global human rights."
BernieSanders,"The party leadership must always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race."

realDonaldTrump,"Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in America difficult!"

realDonaldTrump,Great job Thom!

realDonaldTrump,"I don’t know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading, but it sure wasn’t the one given to me. With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men & women working there!"
BernieSanders,Thank you to @BenedictEDU for hosting me this afternoon. Your generation has the power to transform this nation.
realDonaldTrump,"What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
realDonaldTrump,"The reason the Democrats don’t want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they don’t want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath, nor do they want the Whistleblower, the missing second Whistleblower, the informer, the Bidens, to testify!"
realDonaldTrump,"....Election, and negate the votes of millions of Evangelicals in the process. They know the only Impeachable offense that President Trump has committed was beating Hillary Clinton in 2016. That’s the unpardonable sin for which the Democrats will never forgive him....."

realDonaldTrump,"The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY!"

BernieSanders,"The question isn’t whether the United States, the wealthiest country in the world, can AFFORD to provide health care for every man, woman, and child. The question is whether we have the moral courage to make a basic human right a priority at the top of our country’s agenda."
realDonaldTrump,"....story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn’t want to report!"

BernieSanders,"Out of 35 major countries the U.S. ranks 30th in math, 24th in reading, and 19th in science. Let me be as clear as I can: as the wealthiest country in the history of the world there is no reason we shouldn't have the best education system in the world."

realDonaldTrump,The Woodward book is a scam. I don’t talk the way I am quoted. If I did I would not have been elected President. These quotes were made up. The author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle. I wish the people could see the real facts - and our country is doing GREAT!

realDonaldTrump,Thanks Jim. Would be great to just run our Country!
BernieSanders,Private media outlets charge outrageous sums to run ads during presidential primary debates like tonight's—and many of their advertisers have vested interest in who is elected. This type of influence must end. We're going to ban advertising during presidential primary debates.
realDonaldTrump,"Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!"

realDonaldTrump,So great being with you both in the Oval Office!

realDonaldTrump,"So, it has now been determined, by 18 people that truly hate President Trump, that there was No Collusion with Russia. In fact, it was an illegal investigation that should never have been allowed to start. I fought back hard against this Phony & Treasonous Hoax!"
