2,RepDrewFerguson,Republican,Many thanks to my first class of summer interns in Washington. They've been hard at work for the folks of #GA03.
3,RepJoshG,Democrat,"Our economy needs a shot in the arm to spur growth.  As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, I’ve been working around-the-clock with both parties since I was sworn in to make living in our District more affordable.  By seeking the facts and stepping up to solve tax reform and infrastructure in a non-partisan and fiscally responsible way, we can grow our businesses, create more jobs, and lower our taxes."
4,RepWesterman,Republican,"Last week was busy as I met with constituents from across Arkansas. If you are going to be in Washington and would like to arrange a meeting or a tour of the Capitol, please reach out to my office at (202) 225-3772."
5,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"Even as families nationwide marveled at the science of the solar eclipse——President Trump again rejected scientific counsel for his own pro-pollution agenda. His Administration disbanded a group of academics, local officials, and corporate officers that was working to help policymakers and companies plan for the impact climate change. Rather than allow these experts to bring their findings to light, Trump would keep us in the dark."
6,RepDelBene,Democrat,"The strength of our local economy depends on a well-maintained, modern infrastructure. I’m pleased U.S. Senate Democrats introduced an #infrastructure plan that includes many smart investments, including $20 billion to help improve access to #broadband for the unserved and underserved populations across America. In the House, I'm fighting to ensure everyone has access to opportunity in the 21st century economy."

11,ScottDesJarlaisTN04,Republican,"New VA Secretary David Shulkin pledged yesterday to get rid of VA employees who deserve to be fired for legitimate issues. There is no excuse for substandard care for our nation’s veterans. Unacceptable wait times, a lack of specialty care providers, and poor treatment of veterans seeking care is shameful and will not be tolerated."
12,RepMikeGallagher,Republican,"Proud to lead my Wisconsin colleagues in a letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma on behalf of the more than 370,000 veterans in our state. They deserve to have their questions answered about the quality of care being provided to veterans at King."

14,RepLowenthal,Democrat,I was proud this week to join 120 colleagues in signing a letter to FBI Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein calling on him protect the integrity and independence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The Special Counsel and his team must be allowed to complete their investigation. President Trump must know any attempt to end this investigation will unleash a political crisis he will not be able to contain. Read the entire letter on my website by clicking below.

17,HurdOnTheHill,Republican,Really enjoyed sharing stories with HACU National Internship Program Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities interns from my time in the CIA and how that influenced my decision to run for congress. Thank y’all for having me!
18,RepKinzinger,Republican,"To say I’m disgusted would be an understatement.  By meeting with the mass murderer of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, Tulsi Gabbard has legitimized his dictatorship and in turn, legitimized his genocide against the Syrian people - the murdering of 50,000+ innocent children among the nearly half million total slaughtered by his regime. A whole generation of Syrian children that could have been police officers, teachers, or doctors, but whose lives were cut short by barrel bombs and airstrikes.   It is beyond reprehensible and cannot possibly be justified."
19,RepBobGibbs,Republican,"This weekend's violence in Charlottesville, and the hate that fueled it, is antithetical to America and our common values. It has no place in our nation. I pray for the families of those injured or killed and hope justice is served against those who perpetrated such awful criminal acts."
20,JodeyArrington,Republican,"Israel is our steadfast ally and the only true democracy in the Middle East.  I am proud to stand with Israel through this resolution denouncing President Obama’s deplorable treatment of our longtime partner in freedom. I applaud my colleague, Congressman Ed Royce (CA-39), for his leadership.    Rest assured, I will continue to work tirelessly alongside our new administration to repair our partnership with Israel."
21,RepresentativeValDemings,Democrat,"This morning, I toured the Hurricane Irma damage in Orlo Vista, one of the most impacted communities in Florida’s 10th Congressional District.

22,RepMimiWalters,Republican,Happy 70th birthday to the @USairforce! Thank you to all of the brave Airmen who fought for the freedom and safety of our great Nation! #AFBday
23,RepJoshG,Democrat,"This morning, I was honored to attend Closter's memorial service to remember 9/11 and the souls we lost that day. The service was also attended by students from Northern Valley Regional High School, many born after September 11, 2001. For them, especially, we must pass down the memory of our friends, family, and neighbors who were lost that day, so that our nation will #NeverForget.  While our New Jersey communities and our nation lost so much that day, we also learned just how resilient we can be and how strong we must remain in the continued face of terror.   To all of the first responders that ran towards the fires and rubble that day, we thank you for your service and sacrifice.   To those veterans and men and women in activate duty, thank you for protecting our homeland.   To all of those who lost loved ones that day, our community stands with you today and every day.   With our strength and perseverance, America will always be the greatest nation in the world, and our best days will always be ahead of us."
24,Rep.Grijalva,Democrat,"Joined my Democratic colleagues today in introducing the #AmericanHopeAct, a legislative fix that protects #DREAMers from deportation, allows them to apply for permanent residency, and provides a pathway to US citizenship."
25,SenatorLankford,Republican,"There has been a lot of confusion about what’s happening with the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, also called CHIP. Jimmy Kimmel discussed it on his late-night show last night, so I wanted to clear some things up.   HERE ARE THE FACTS: Created in 1997, CHIP is a healthcare federal block grant program to the states to provide health insurance for low-income children who don’t qualify for Medicaid. This CHIP block grant is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and must be matched with state dollars. In Oklahoma, approximately 180,000 children benefit from this block grant program. On October 1, 2017, the federal funding authorization for the program expired, however, there is enough money in the program to fund it until March 2018 for most states, including Oklahoma.    I want to be clear: I fully support the CHIP program. Unfortunately, there are some serious management inefficiencies, fraud, and waste within the CHIP program that need to be addressed. I am eager to see some fiscally responsible and sustainable reforms made to the program so that it’s strengthened for the families who rely on it and the funding for the program can go undisturbed for years to come. Children and families are counting on us to put in safeguards now so that cuts are not necessary in the future. Although the funding for this program lasts until next Spring, I want a solution sooner rather than later. I don’t sit on the committee working on CHIP reforms (Senate Finance Committee), but I am working with my colleagues to ensure that children continue to get the support they need, and I will keep you updated in the days ahead."
26,RepresentativeSteveKnight,Republican,"My staff enjoyed reading today at Gregg Anderson Academy for the Annual Read Across America Day. This year-round program focuses on motivating children and teens to read through events, partnerships, and reading resources. Thank you to Mrs. Diaz and the other amazing teachers that give of their time and resources to impact the students of the Antelope Valley."
27,RepJasonLewis,Republican,"As we approach Memorial Day, I'll be speaking on the Floor after votes tonight to recognize our military and our fallen soldiers. Through their service and selflessness, our nation’s sons and daughters have kept our country strong and free.  Tune in after 6pm CST at the C-Span link below."
28,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"According to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of uninsured Americans has plummeted in recent years thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2015 alone, 900,000 Americans gained quality health care under the ACA, a landmark law I’m proud to have brought to the floor as chairwoman of the Rules Committee in 2009. Despite this major progress, the president is still dangerously pushing ahead by gutting enrollment outreach efforts and threatening to cut funding for cost-sharing subsidies. Protecting the health of millions of Americans who rely on this law should be a bipartisan effort. I’m outraged by the president’s indifference and will never stop working to protect your care."
29,RepMimiWalters,Republican,My thoughts and prayers are with people of Florida and those in Hurricane #Irma’s path. #CA45 stands with you.
30,RepJoyceBeatty,Democrat,"Kevin was unable to get health insurance because of a preexisting condition. Thanks to the #ACA, he and his family's lives are forever changed.   Thank you, Kevin, for sharing your story and for joining me at tonight's #JointSession."
31,RepSeanMaloney,Democrat,"The anchorage proposal is a mess and our bipartisan team from the Hudson Valley is working together to sink it. Today I was in Yonkers with Rep.

32,RepresentativeDougCollins,Republican,"Working to make sure bad actors don't exploit H-1B visas to strip Americans of their jobs and force them to train their replacements.

34,RepNormaTorres,Democrat,"Every day, 19 children are either killed or injured by a firearm.  National ASK Day is a reminder that while it might be an uncomfortable question, asking if there’s a gun in a home where your children will play and what measures are taken to secure it can help save lives."
35,SenatorKaine,Democrat,"November is National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month and National Family Caregivers Month, and I’m thinking about families – including my own – who care for those living with Alzheimer’s. To help alleviate the painful burden this disease has on patients and their families, I introduced a bipartisan bill with  U.S. Senator Susan Collins,  Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, and Senator Shelley Moore Capito that would improve care and outcomes by providing a full range of information and support to families caring for loved ones with Alzheimer’s. I’m extremely thankful for the work of the Alzheimer's Association and its local chapters in Virginia communities and across the country to help patients and their families. https://fcnp.com/2017/11/09/kaine-introduces-alzheimer-legislation/"

37,CongresswomanRosaDeLauro,Democrat,"Are you looking for tax preparation assistance? Make tax season easier with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program where local volunteer sites are available to help qualifying constituents prepare and file income tax returns.  Help is available through the VITA program to people who generally make $54,000 or less, persons with disabilities and limited English speaking taxpayers who need assistance in preparing their own tax returns.   In addition, the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program offers free tax help for all taxpayers, particularly those who are 60 years of age and older, specializing in questions about pensions and retirement-related issues unique to seniors.  Use the VITA / TCE Locator Tool on IRS.gov to find help near you"

39,RepSeanMaloney,Democrat,"Millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico are in serious danger – they don’t have electricity, they don’t have clean water, and they needed our help yesterday. We’ve got the resources and personnel necessary to save lives and help our fellow Americans rebuild – it’s time to get in gear and get them on the ground. I urge the President to send help immediately and to send Congress an updated FEMA funding request ASAP."
40,RepMarkTakano,Democrat,"The Secretary of the Department of Labor is supposed to be the leading advocate for America's workers. There is simply no way that Andy Puzder is qualified to fill that role.   In his two decades as the CEO of a fast food giant, Puzder has faced numerous complaints of wage theft, workplace discrimination, and unsafe working conditions. He also opposes raising the minimum wage and opposes restoring overtime protections to millions of middle class workers.   At the very least, the Labor Secretary should believe in the mission of the agency…and Andy Puzder does not. The Senate should reject his nomination."
41,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"President Trump wanted the FBI as his own police force, not America’s police force, demanding loyalty to him, not our country. You can watch former FBI Director James Comey's testimony starting at 9:00 a.m. CT today."

43,congresswomansusanwbrooks,Republican,"For over 25 years, Open Doors of Washington Township has helped #Hoosiers in the Westfield Washington Township area and done so with integrity, respect, honesty, fairness, and stewardship. It was an honor to be a part of the grand opening of their new facility, and I was happy to meet so many dedicated volunteers. Open Doors' work has improved the lives of people in need since 1990 through their centralized food and clothing pantry, community assistance operations and seasonal special programs. Open Doors is an example of the good that can come from coming together despite our differences to help our neighbors. To date, they have served over 13,000 families with over 670,000 pounds of food!

46,congressmanpittenger,Republican,"Tonight, we have the great privilege of hearing from President Donald J. Trump as he sets forth his plans to protect our great freedoms.  He'll be speaking, of course, from the U.S. Capitol, which represents freedom, liberty, and opportunity to all of us in America, and so many around the world who hold our values in high esteem.  Below is a video I recorded to give friends like you a quick tour of the Capitol, including a behind-the-scenes view of the Lincoln Room and a preview of what President Trump will see as he enters the House Chamber.

49,SenatorWhitehouse,Democrat,"The pressure on the Department of Justice to put the political demands of the President above the law is going to require the highest degree of independence from the Attorney General.

He will be a tremendous asset to the federal bench, in my opinion. Tennessee is fortunate President Trump nominated such a well-qualified nominee. Senator Norris is respected by his peers around the country, having been elected chairman of the Council of State Governments, and has been an advocate and a champion for federalism and for the separation of powers. He is a citizen, a lawyer and a legislator, and I have known him for many years – since I was the governor of Tennessee."

See the official word from FEMA below, and don't hesitate to contact our office if we can be of assistance.   ###   The Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) requires a policyholder to send the insurer a complete, signed, and sworn proof of loss within 60 days after the date of loss.  Due to the significant, widespread flooding that occurred in portions of Louisiana between August 9, 2016 and August 31, 2016, FEMA issued two Write Your Own (WYO) Bulletins extending the proof of loss deadline:   • WYO Bulletin W-16067 (September 9, 2016) – 60 Day Extension • WYO Bulletin W-16089 (December 2, 2016) – 60 Day Extension   To allow policyholders time to finalize their claims, an additional limited waiver of the 60-day proof of loss requirement has been issued, extending the period an additional 90 days.  With this extension, a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholder will have a total of 270 days after the date of loss to provide the completed, signed, and sworn-to proof of loss to the insurer.  This waiver is issued pursuant to 44 CFR § 61.13(d) and the SFIP.  This waiver does not alter any other terms or conditions of the SFIP.   In order to expedite the recovery process, policyholders are urged to submit a proof of loss as soon as possible.  Policyholders should contact their insurer for assistance with filing a proof of loss."

I'm planning to ask him about many of the issues we care about in Michigan, including keeping the #GreatLakes clean and keeping our commitment to Flint families. If you've got questions for the Administrator, please post them in the comments below and I will do my best to include them this afternoon."
95,RepresentativeValDemings,Democrat,"If Congress doesn't protect American families, who will?   The Financial CHOICE Act will roll back Dodd-Frank consumer protections that were enacted after the financial Crisis of 2008 and protect consumers from predatory lenders.

97,RepJeffDuncan,Republican,"Once again, President Trump has gotten it right. Choosing a nominee of the stature of Judge Gorsuch shows a continued commitment to originalist and textualist principles that served our country well with Justice Scalia, and will continue to serve us well in the future.  I am particularly heartened that President Trump has nominated a justice who will play a key role as the Court decides issues related to Life, religious liberty, and the proper role of government. Judge Gorsuch’s rulings and comments on these matters gives me great hope that he will be a forceful conservative voice on the Court for decades to come.  I look forward to a speedy confirmation in the Senate, and I call on our Senators to get Judge Gorsuch on the bench as quickly as possible to get the Court back on track."
98,Rep.Grijalva,Democrat,"The ACA is not perfect, but our options are to improve a law that already works for millions of Americans, or scrap it for empty promises of better care at cheaper costs. Republicans have campaigned on calls to “repeal and replace” for six years, and yet they never bothered to offer a plan. Now, with control of both houses of Congress and the White House — and with their backs against a wall to deliver on this political fantasy they’ve been selling their base — the GOP is rushing through a plan that is literally a disaster in waiting."
99,SenatorRichardBurr,Republican,"Nikki Haley will bring a fresh perspective to the United Nations. She has a record of success in South Carolina and is well prepared to engage with world leaders and craft solutions to the world’s most difficult humanitarian crises and political conflicts.

100,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"Forty-four million people across the country owe over $1.3 trillion in student loans, with the average 2016 graduate owing more than $37,000. In today’s competitive global economy, we need more students graduating with a college degree and less graduating with unsurmountable debt. The spending agreement reached over the weekend is a step toward a solution because it expands Pell grant eligibility to include low-income students attending year-round classes and would provide one million students with an average award of $1,650. This is a smart, bipartisan approach to making college more affordable. Protecting the right for all students to get a college education is a top priority of mine and I recently co-sponsored the Affordability for Constant and Continual Education to Enhance Student Success (ACCESS) Act, which would reinstate the summer Pell Grant, allowing students to complete their degrees on time as well as participate in accelerated programs that require summer courses. If we want to inspire the next generation workforce in photonics, teaching, arts, STEM, or any other field, we have to make college degrees more, not less, accessible."

102,congressmanpittenger,Republican,"China is acquiring American companies at a breathtaking pace. To be specific, between 2012 and 2016, Chinese investment in the US increased by over 900%. What is concerning is that much of the investment is controlled or directed by China’s Communist leadership as part of a strategy to target American infrastructure and companies that provide critical national security services.    For the past two years, I have been leading a bipartisan Congressional effort to increase U.S. scrutiny of specific Chinese investments which threaten our national security. In the coming days, I will being introducing new legislation to strengthen our procedures for blocking foreign investments which threaten America’s national security."

Or, we can vote to keep America healthy. Vote to keep protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Vote for a healthcare system that doesn’t discriminate against women.

155,RepEliotLEngel,Democrat,"Today marks five years since a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and took the lives of twenty children and six educators. It will forever be one of the saddest days in our nation’s history.   The events of December 14th, 2012 are still as shocking and horrific today as they were five years ago. The thought that somebody, anybody, could commit such a heinous act was unconscionable then, as it is now. I still pray for the families of those school children and educators who were killed that day. Their lives will forever be ingrained in our national consciousness.    While we mourn the twenty-six lives lost five years ago today, we also mourn the loss of the 120,000 other Americans who have been killed by guns since that terrible tragedy. This year has been especially deadly; there have been more mass shootings in 2017 than there have been days, and three of the five deadliest mass shootings in our recent history have taken place in the past year.   Gun violence is a national crisis, and we cannot let another year go by without a response. It is long past time that Congress pass legislation to address the gun violence epidemic in our country. Yet, just last week Republicans in the House passed the dangerous Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act to make it easier to carry loaded weapons in public spaces.   As we remember the twenty-six innocent lives lost in Newtown, I urge my colleagues in Congress to commit to passing commonsense gun safety legislation to prevent future tragedies related to gun violence."

169,senatorfeinstein,Democrat,"Covered California has made clear that the latest Senate Republican bill would have devastating effects on our individual insurance market. Next year alone, 700,000 Californians would lose their coverage. Premiums would increase by 20 percent more than projected, leaving the market far less stable. Far from addressing affordability, which Republicans claim to care about, this bill intentionally makes the problem worse.    Covered California is working. That’s because there is a balance between healthy and sick enrollees. Maintaining this balance is critical to keeping premiums from skyrocketing. This latest bill would make that task impossible and it should be defeated."

That’s why Congress has recently passed tougher sanctions on North Korea, and why this administration is hoping for the best while preparing for the worst.

201,repscottperry,Republican,"I’ve argued for years that Republicans had an obligation to aggressively promote alternatives to the ACA, rather than just opposing it. I’m fighting for a 21st Century health care system that’s affordable, stable and secure; one that offers us more choices, lower costs and greater control over our health care. Congress must ensure a stable transition period to a better healthcare system so no one has the rug pulled out from under them. The House is taking a step-by-step approach to achieve this and here's an update: http://bit.ly/2kqz0K1. While the ACA was jammed through Congress only to find out what was in it after it passed, know that I'll update you every step of the way along this process - no surprises."

Agriculture is among upstate New York’s most important industries and has for decades been a vital part of our region’s heritage.

I am working to protect Upstate agriculture, push back against bad trade deals, and fight federal overreach. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 281, the Family Farm Relief Act. This bill streamlines the H-2A Agricultural Visa program so that it works better for farmers who lack access to a stable and reliable labor pool. I also supported passage of H.R. 26, the REINS Act. This bill would require Congressional approval of significant agency regulations that have the potential to impact agriculture.

244,senatorjeffflake,Republican,"One of the most important elements of the rule of law is the promise of swift access to the courts. That promise has been broken in my home state of Arizona. That’s because Arizona falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a circuit that is both oversized and overworked.   With a jurisdiction encompassing thirteen district courts spread over nine states and two U.S. territories, the 9th Circuit covers one in five Americans. It hears roughly 12,000 appeals each year – the next busiest circuit doesn’t even hear 9,000. And for the thousands of cases under its consideration, the average turnaround time exceeds 15 months.  If excessive delays weren’t bad enough, it turns out the 9th Circuit is overturned by the Supreme Court 77 percent of the time. So not only is the court excruciatingly slow, but in many instances, it’s simply wrong.  The court itself is unusually large. It has twenty-nine authorized judgeships. That’s 12 more than the next largest circuit. The 9th Circuit is so big that it can’t even rehear cases as a whole body, like every other federal appeals court. Instead, cases are reheard with “limited en banc” panels of 11 judges each. That means only a third of its judges are deciding the law for the entire court.  Of the states suffering under the weight of the 9th Circuit’s crushing backlog, Arizona shoulders a uniquely heavy burden. Per capita, Arizona has the busiest federal docket in the circuit. This puts Arizonans at the back of an already long line, just to get their day in court. And as the deluge of cases continues to fill the 9th Circuit’s docket, that line keeps getting longer and longer for folks in Arizona.   With problems like these, we’re left to ask: Is the 9th Circuit too big to succeed?  For Arizona, the answer is unquestionably yes.   Arizonans deserve better, and that’s why today, I’m reintroducing a bill to break up the 9th Circuit.   With the support of my colleague from Arizona, Senator John McCain, and our Governor Doug Ducey, I’ve authored the Judicial Administration and Improvement Act. This bill would create a new 12th Circuit by moving Arizona, as well as Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington out of the 9th Circuit. Doing so would create two smaller appellate courts where one dysfunctional court stood. All the while, establishing stronger local, regional, and cultural ties. This would help alleviate the 9th Circuit’s enormous caseload and ensure a more timely and accurate judicial process for both circuits.   Importantly, the bill would also free the new circuit from the 9th Circuit’s precedent. This means states like Arizona will be able to chart their own legal course, consistent with their local needs and traditions. A fair and functioning judiciary is one of the pillars of our democracy. Geography shouldn’t limit a citizen’s access to the courts.  The Judicial Administration and Improvement Act will right this wrong by restoring faith in our judicial system and securing the access to justice that Arizonans deserve."

It is also critical for China and Russia to strictly enforce all international sanctions and if they do not, then we must take steps to sanction companies and individuals that violate UN or US restrictions on activities with the North Koreans, as we did recently.

278,15083070102.0,Republican,"Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released their long-term budget outlook for the federal government.  In a word, it’s frightening.  The federal debt is now $20 trillion and growing rapidly. The CBO outlined further risk going forward:   “Large and growing federal debt over the coming decades would hurt the economy (. . .) The amount of debt that is projected would (. . .) increase the government’s interest costs, putting more pressure on the rest of the budget; limit lawmakers’ ability to respond to unforeseen events; and increase the likelihood of a fiscal crisis, an occurrence in which investors become unwilling to finance a government’s borrowing unless they are compensated with very high interest rates.”    This is why I’m so opposed to wasteful spending, especially overseas.  Borrowing billions from the Chinese and Russians, to then give to Afghanistan and other countries that hate us, is just stupid.

279,janschakowsky,Democrat,"Every day the need to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the ties between the Trump Administration and the Russian government’s assault on our democracy becomes more urgent. From yesterday’s revelation that the President mishandled highly classified intelligence from our ally Israel to today’s reports of his shameless abuse of power, the need for further investigation is now undeniable.  My Republican colleagues can no longer dismiss the irresponsible and unethical behavior of President Trump. We need a full independent investigation, and history will not look kindly on those who sat idle while our democratic institutions were threatened."

It’s also critical that a new Labor secretary understands the needs of folks who shower after work. It’s our blue-collar and minimum-wage laborers who perform back-breaking work every day, but often lose sleep wondering how they’re going to make ends meet, what happens if they get sick, or how they’re going to save for retirement. Rural Americans need a fighter – for a livable wage, health and retirement protections, and for commonsense workplace leave policies."

Kennedy climbed atop the bed of a flatbed truck in Indianapolis and addressed a large crowd in the heart of the city's African-American community. “I have bad news for you, for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and killed tonight.” The crowd, many of whom had not heard the news, were clearly shaken. RFK continued, “Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice for his fellow human beings, and he died because of that effort.” RFK talked about understanding the feelings of rage, and hatred, and violence when confronted with such a tragedy. For the first time in public since 1963, he spoke of losing his own brother to violence. What we can take from the tragic murder of Dr. King, and what RFK returned to as he finished—was a summation of Dr. King’s spirit, “What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be black.” Love, wisdom, compassion, and justice.

The administration’s proposed cuts to the EPA and this facility are short-sighted and would create uncertainty, cost jobs and potentially destroy our country’s competitive edge in this important field.

I want to express my appreciation to Congressman Young for hosting us, and his focus on a broad array of important issues.”   “I really appreciate the warm welcome from Alaska’s Samoan community because they made this trip so memorable,” continued the Congresswoman. “Despite the difference in weather, Alaska and American Samoa share similarities in our distance from the rest of the United States, and it’s valuable to see how this remote state operates. I take every chance I can to describe the unique challenges of economic and geographic isolation in American Samoa to my colleagues in Washington, and through activities like this one, that important message continues to be heard.”  Aumua Amata is in Alaska as part of a Congressional Western Caucus visit hosted by Congressman Don Young of Alaska, along with Chairman Paul Gosar (AZ), Rep. Dan Newhouse (WA), Rep Bruce Westerman (AR), and other congressional personnel for an in-depth economic development and natural resources visit.

320,rfrelinghuysen,Republican,"Recovery Assistance Surges to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands  WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is conducting aggressive 24-hour search and rescue and recovery operations, with an array of U.S. government partners, in an ongoing effort to provide immediate assistance to the residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as they recover from successive Hurricanes Irma and Maria, reported U.S. Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen (NJ-11), the Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations.    “The personal accounts and pictures coming out of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are heartbreaking as the residents of these two territories struggle in the aftermath of two colossal storms,” said Frelinghuysen.  “Congress will continue to work with the Administration to make sure that our fellow Americans get every resource they need as soon as possible.”  According to FEMA, the top priority of the federal government is continuing to provide life sustaining resources to the islands, bringing additional essential commodities in and restoring power at hospitals, ports, airports, and other critical facilities.  FEMA, working in coordination with its federal partners and an array of non-profit organizations, has already provided more than four million meals, six million liters of water, nearly 300 infant and toddler kits, and nearly 70,000 emergency roofing kits to the two areas since Hurricane Maria’s landfall.  Thousands of federal staff, including more than 600 FEMA personnel, are on the ground in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands supporting response and recovery operations.   The federal government is working with its interagency, non-profit partners and faith-based charities to support the transportation and delivery of fuel, based on priorities identified by emergency personnel on the ground in the islands.  The federal support for fuel transportation includes air and sea logistical support by the Defense Logistics Agency, U.S. Northern Command, the U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard, in coordination with the private sector.    Examples of additional federal support:   • The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has deployed 11 ships and over 100 aircraft to assist operations. Personnel continue to deliver critical FEMA relief supplies.  A mobile communications team arrived in Puerto Rico to help improve communications across the storm-impacted area.   • The Department of Defense has over 2,600 personnel in the Caribbean. The USS Oak Hill and the USS Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group have conducted medical evacuations and 123 airlifts and delivered 22,200 pounds of relief supplies and cargo to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The Army’s 602nd Area Support Medical Company and a Civil Authority Information Support Element have been deployed to the Virgin Islands.  • The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an order on September 24 authorizing FEMA and DoD to install and operate temporary water treatment units to provide clean water in the U.S. Virgin Islands to address concerns about a lack of clean water supplies. • Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the DOD conducted medical evacuations for more than 150 patients from the islands to the continental United States. Medical evacuations from the islands will continue.  • The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) deployed debris experts to assist FEMA with debris management strategies in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands.  Additionally, USACE has 86 generators on hand in Puerto Rico and St. Thomas with more than 186 additional generators en route. USACE and other supporting agencies have completed nine temporary power installs on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   • Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations personnel are onsite in St. Thomas to evaluate, fix, and install FAA equipment, in support of air traffic control operations. • The National Guard Bureau (NGB) has thousands of Guard members on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands taking part in security and support operations. The Air Guard is focused on transporting food, water, and communications equipment.  • Customs and Border Protection airplanes and helicopters are assisting with conducting damage assessment and search and rescue missions. • More than 180 Federal Law Enforcement Officers are in San Juan and the Virgin Islands supporting search and rescue and medical teams.    ""The people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands remain in our thoughts.   There is no doubt that the challenges they face are truly tremendous. While significant progress has been made, full recovery will be very long and very trying. But the people should be reassured that they are entitled to equal treatment under the law and the Appropriations Committee and House Leadership will assure that every step of the way.""  “The Appropriations Committee plays a central role in ensuring that the federal government provides the help the victims need.  It is important to reassure residents and local officials that that we will help them rebuild.”     -30-"

334,RepAdamSchiff,Democrat,"On Friday, I will be attending the Inauguration and on Saturday I will march with constituents who traveled to DC for the Women's March. I want to share my thoughts on these upcoming events, even though I know many of you may disagree with my decision.   This is the first time I've ever truly considered not attending an Inauguration, both because of a foreign adversarial power's role in Donald Trump's election, and because of his deplorable conduct before and after November 7.   During the campaign, I repeatedly warned of Russia's interference in our democracy and the assistance it was giving Trump by hacking and releasing documents detrimental to Secretary Clinton. In fact, as the Ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Senator Feinstein and I took the rare step of attributing the hacks to Russia well before the Administration was willing to, and I will be helping to lead the investigation into its pernicious interference in our affairs.   Since the election, Trump has only made matters worse, continuing his denials of the extent of Russian involvement and persisting in offensive conduct that only divides the country.   There are few people I respect more than John Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement and a man I was honored to join in a civil rights pilgrimage to the Edmund Pettis Bridge and during a sit-in on the House floor to protest inaction on gun violence.   Trump's lack of respect for Rep. Lewis and his insulting attitude towards others offends me greatly. As I have said many times, no one is doing more to undermine the legitimacy of Donald Trump's Presidency than Donald Trump.   So why go?   In my view, Congressional participation at a Presidential Inauguration is not about the President, it's about the Presidency. Yes, many in the public attend because they are pleased with the election and want to be present when their candidate is sworn in. But the reason that Congress surrounds the new President during the ceremony -- members from both parties -- is not because both parties are pleased with the result of the election. Far from it. We participate on a bipartisan basis because we are acknowledging the peaceful transition of power that is the hallmark of our democracy.   Like many of you, I was appalled when candidate Trump wouldn't commit to respecting the result of the election if he lost. I feel I would be doing the same thing if I boycotted the ceremony in which the office of the Presidency is passed from one occupant of the office to the next. There's a reason why Senators Harris and Sanders and others are attending the Inauguration, and it is out of respect for the office, even if the man who is taking the oath has demonstrated little understanding of what that means. If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton can demonstrate the grit to attend the Inauguration after Trump's slanderous attacks on her, then so can I.  On the day following the Inauguration, I will join constituents in Washington for the Women's March and participate in another fundamental aspect of our democracy -- the right to protest. Our message that day, and every day of his Presidency will be the same: That we will not allow Trump to roll back the progress we have made, that his actions and words have consequences, that we will hold him accountable, that demeaning women, minorities and anyone who disagrees with him will not be acceptable, and that we will not be silent.  Once again, thank you for sharing your thoughts and I hope you will continue to do so."

He has renewed President Reagan’s policy to ensure American taxpayers are not forced to subsidize abortions anywhere in the world. He has followed through on his promise to insist on better trade agreements. And by instituting a hiring freeze, he has taken a critical first step toward reining in Washington bureaucracy. I look forward to working with the president to build on these actions and deliver results for the people."

They likely prevented more injuries, and that commitment is laudable in the extreme. South Carolina knows all too well the sacrifice that the men and women of the Capitol Police make to serve and protect the Congress.

Under our tax cuts plan, we’ll unleash West Virginia’s economic potential, create jobs, and put more money back into the pockets of hardworking West Virginians.

Over the past few weeks, I've been working with a group of Republican and Democratic senators on some reforms. As part of these discussions, we have met with governors, insurance commissioners, patients, and insurers, to talk about how to improve health care. We can harness that spirit of bipartisanship into real results, instead of the bad political bills that the Senate keeps bringing up. As these discussions now continue, I'm hopeful that we're going to reach some real solutions that work for families across our state. Yesterday, I spoke with WDAY-TV about these discussions.

398,RepTomSuozzi,Democrat,"It’s really disappointing that this ill-advised health care law was written behind closed doors and without any input from the Democrats. This is a time for all of us – Democrats and Republicans – to be working together to improve health care. This proposed legislation does the exact opposite. Now they want to rush it through to a vote in the Senate before anyone has a chance to find out what’s really in this bill and the impact it will have on Americans.   I’ve always said and still say that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect and we need to ‘mend it, not end it.’ This deeply flawed Senate proposal, however, will result in skyrocketing premiums and deductibles, a burdensome age tax, will take millions of people off the health care rolls, make deep cuts to Medicaid and make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to receive proper care.  I call on the Senate to reject this legislation, take a page from the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus (where I serve as Vice-Chair with 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans), come back to the drawing board, and openly work together so that we can give the American people the high-quality, affordable health care they deserve."

403,8037068318.0,Democrat,"For an entire week, the President was touting his concern for the shipping industry, while refusing to suspend the Jones Act. Meanwhile, the people of Puerto Rico have been facing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Millions of American citizens are without food, water and electricity. Now, the President’s change of heart is too little, too late.  A ten-day waiver, as the Administration has announced, is far from sufficient given the scope of this tragedy.  Moreover, as Puerto Rico begins the long road of rebuilding, it will be difficult to do so if building supplies cost double what they are priced on the mainland. To that end, I repeat my previous call for a one-year waiver of the Jones Act.  Puerto Rico’s economy was already suffering immensely before Maria and its economy will undoubtedly be devastated from the hurricane. If there were ever a time to consider a longer term suspension of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico, this would be it."

But the bill Republicans released today is a sham. President Trump promised the American people a tax reform plan that cuts taxes on the middle class and creates good-paying jobs. Instead, the plan Republicans released today will give 80% of the tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest 1%. It will cut trillions of dollars from Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that support working families, including education, infrastructure investments, and health care for veterans. 173,000 Rhode Islanders will see their taxes go up because they will lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal return.

423,senatortomudall,Democrat,"With more artists per capita than any other state, New Mexico is home to one of the most vibrant artistic communities in the nation, and our artists play a vital role in shaping our culture, attracting tourists, and creating jobs. One in 10 jobs in New Mexico is related to arts and culture. That’s why, today, I reintroduced a bill to stimulate the development of arts businesses, jobs and the creative economy in New Mexico and across the nation. The Comprehensive Resources for Entrepreneurs in the Arts to Transform the Economy (CREATE) Act would support artists, entrepreneurs and workers employed in tourism and cultural development in growing their businesses, accessing federal resources and funding, and expanding their networks with local communities.    We heard enormous support when we first unveiled this bill in New Mexico last year, but we knew it could be improved. I want to thank the many New Mexico artists who offered suggestions and helped shape this updated legislation. They told us that artists and entrepreneurs need more help raising startup funds, and with marketing — so we have added that to the bill.   We are reintroducing the CREATE Act at a time when the arts are facing enormous cuts to funding in our country, making it harder for artists and artistic entrepreneurs to access resources to help grow their businesses and fund their projects. That makes it that much more urgent to pass provisions in this bill to ensure that emerging artists, museums and galleries and artistic entrepreneurs have the support they need to expand our creative economy and create jobs. As the lead Democrat on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee over arts funding, I will continue to fight for strong resources to help protect and grow New Mexico’s creative economy."

Trump’s executive actions to prohibit individuals, except for those with green cards, traveling from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days while also putting a hold on the refugee admission program for 120 days so that the Administration has time to strengthen screening procedures:   “I find it refreshing and encouraging that our new administration is taking extra steps to better ensure the safety of all Americans, just as President Trump promised during the campaign that he would.  I agree with every word of President Trump’s statement yesterday, which clarifies the scope and intentions behind these temporary policy changes.”   The full statement President Trump released yesterday is below:   “America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.”"

Whether it’s improving resilience and reliability, ensuring better protection from cyberattacks, or increasing efficiency, we need to empower states to make the necessary changes to modernize the grid. Instead of government mandates and taxpayer money to fix the problem, let’s have industry and regulators work together in a collaborative way to find solutions that can be applied across the country.

It decimates education programs like Pell Grants; slashes food nutrition programs; cuts investments in our infrastructure; and kicks off millions from health care by undermining the ACA, cutting $473 billion from Medicare and $1 trillion from Medicaid.  Even worse, it paves the way for tax cuts that will add up to $1.5 trillion to the national debt to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires.  The Republican tax plan will actually raise taxes on about 104,000 middle-class New Mexicans.  In short, it prioritizes the rich and powerful at the expense of everybody else."

472,CongressmanDougLamborn,Republican,"Today I introduced landmark reform legislation that allows veterans to choose civilian medical providers or use existing VA medical facilities, without requiring VA pre-authorization.   The Veterans Empowerment Act would give veterans options similar to the highly-successful Tricare Standard program long in use by the active duty military community.  This bill throws out the idea of acceptable patient wait times and eliminates the requirement of the veteran to ask for VA permission to use civilian medical providers. It gives veterans full authority to use the existing VA system or not. Giving them options to choose their healthcare plans and doctors is empowering. This bill means veterans, especially those with extreme disabilities, can expect to have their needs taken care of quickly and efficiently. Its good policy and makes sense.

475,CongressmanEricSwalwell,Democrat,"This week, I led a dozen House Members in urging that the upcoming budget encourage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to increase its educational outreach efforts for start-up life science companies.  Life science start-ups need a helping hand to understand the regulatory process on their way to saving lives. Because developing medical technology often takes a lot of money, and many start-ups don’t earn revenue until their products are on the market, a long and complicated approval process can cause the start-ups to fold early. More direct outreach from the Food and Drug Administration could help a lot.  The idea for this came from my Future Forum meeting last year  with millennial start-up executives at QB3, the University of California’s hub for innovation and entrepreneurship in the life sciences."

489,congressmanbuddycarter,Republican,"I am thrilled the American Health Care Act was approved today. For the last seven years, I have watched the health care system that I worked in for more than thirty years crumble under its own weight. Thanks to Obamacare, premiums and health care costs have skyrocketed, choice has been eliminated, and the dire situation is only getting worse. At home in Georgia, 96 counties only have one insurer to choose from on the exchange. That isn't a choice at all. With passage of the AHCA today, we are another step closer to delivering relief and a patient-centered health care system with the choice and control needed to empower patients.   This bill guts Obamacare and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly to let families and patients across America know that help is on the way. The AHCA will ensure patients are no longer forced to live under Washington's one-size-fits-all health care mandates and taxes and it should be signed into law as soon as possible.  I look forward to continuing our work to resuscitate our health care system. As I have always said, the AHCA is a strong first step, but I'm committed it's not the last. The House has already passed additional legislation to lower health insurance costs and take the first step toward allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines and more action is coming. Today is a big win in the fight to repeal and replace Obamacare and it won't be the last."

In 2018, nearly 60 percent of subsidy-eligible enrollees will have access to Silver coverage for less than $100 per month — the same as it was in 2017 — and 74 percent can purchase Bronze coverage for less than $10 per month.   Enrolling is easy. Covered California partners with thousands of certified insurance agents and enrollers across the state to provide free and confidential in-person assistance in a variety of languages. You can also sign up online at www.CoveredCA.com, call Covered California’s service center at (800) 300-1506 or have a certified enroller contact you through the “Help on Demand” feature.   Take the time to learn about your options and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call my East Bay office at 510-370-3322.

Trumpcare would lead to 14 million more people being uninsured in 2018 alone.

Unfortunately, the Senate bill does not achieve these important goals.    “I voted no because I could not support raising taxes on middle income taxpayers and leaving Michigan families without health insurance to pay for huge tax giveaways for the wealthiest one percent of Americans.  “This was a missed opportunity to work together in a bipartisan way on real tax reform.

Agriculture doesn’t just put food on our tables – the USDA’s role includes providing rural housing services, conducting research to expand our farmers’ production capabilities, promoting American-grown products abroad, giving consumers confidence in our food supply and establishing effective safety nets for our producers. Governor Perdue’s years of experience as an advocate for Georgia farmers and ranchers, leadership in the agribusiness sector, and practice as a veterinarian give him a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities faced by rural Americans. I look forward to hearing more from Governor Perdue about his approach and priorities."

It signals to the world that in the face of collective challenges, the U.S. will choose a path of isolation rather than engagement, based on a willful denial of fact.  By capitulating to the demands of fringe voices who reject science and promote reliance on the dirty energy sources of the past, the United States is abdicating our leadership and our responsibility to be stewards of the environment.   Americans from all walks of life understand that the threat posed by climate change is real, and understand the consequences of doing nothing—rising seas, stronger storms, famine and drought, and increased political instability throughout the world.  They also understand the economic opportunity of taking action, embracing innovation, and building the clean energy economy of the future.  It was this consensus that created a global response to climate change, and it is this wisdom that can preserve our planet and protect future generations.   Turning back the clock on environmental progress and risking our future for the benefit of polluting corporations is not a solution. The fight against climate change requires real leadership and political courage—the kind demonstrated by 197 nations when they signed the Paris agreement. Today’s news is a setback, but I will never stop fighting for real solutions to address the threat of climate change."

This proves your calls, letters, and messages are making a difference, but there is still much work to do. Remember, TrumpCare is not a health care bill but a massive tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of millions of children, families, and seniors. To pay for the tax cut Republicans would take $772 billion from Medicaid, which covers 64% of nursing home residents, 49% of all births, and 39% of all children in America; 1.1 million children in LA County alone will be at risk of losing healthcare if TrumpCare is passed.

In her quiet way, she was one of the kindest and most generous champions for our city that I have ever known and her impact will be felt for many years to come. Her long-time leadership and stewardship of the Chattanooga Times informed generations of our citizens and her advocacy for the arts helped transform our community and establish it as a place with tremendous heart and soul. She was a friend to so many and will be greatly missed."

613,CongressmanEricSwalwell,Democrat,"Senate Republicans built this Frankenstein #Trumpcare bill behind closed doors and won’t allow hearings because they know it’s indefensible. It would strip health coverage from millions of hard-working Americans to give tax cuts to those who need it least.   The bill would force Americans ages 50-64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health coverage. It would let states gut coverage of essential health benefits including prescription drugs, maternity care, and mental health care. It would cut Medicaid even deeper than the House bill, kicking millions of low-income Americans off of coverage.   This bill makes America sicker and makes the rich richer. Working Americans can’t have #FreedomToDream without the freedom to be healthy."
614,repohalleran,Democrat,Broadband access in rural Arizona would expand economic and educational opportunities. I am proud to cosponsor legislation to invest in this critical infrastructure.

637,ChelliePingree,Democrat,Today’s bipartisan vote lets Americans whose communities are being ravaged by hurricanes know that we have their backs. It also gives Congress the next three months to work on reaching a budget deal that hopefully will be better for the country than the crippling package of cuts and policy riders the House has been debating this week.

We could fix all of America’s crumbling roads and bridges.   We could replace 1 out of every 3 public schools in America with a new, state-of-the-art facility.

667,reppaulmitchell,Republican,"Today, the House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act.  Families living under the Affordable Care Act have seen their premiums, copays, and deductibles continue to rise. Doing nothing was not an option.    I know from business; rarely can you achieve the ‘perfect’ deal. Perfect doesn’t exist in negotiation.  Over the past few weeks, changes have been made to improve the American Health Care Act.    This final legislation delivers relief from the burdens of the Affordable Care Act, while reaffirming our commitment to ensuring all Americans have access to care.  The American Health Care Act eliminates the Affordable Care Act’s mandates and taxes and establishes a system of incentives through tax credits, rather than punishing individuals for not purchasing insurance.    Those who do not already receive coverage from their employer, Medicaid, or Medicare, are eligible for tax credits to help them purchase insurance.   It has long been a priority of mine to ensure that all Americans, especially those with the highest health care needs and costs, are protected. This legislation targets funds directly to support those who need it most.  Giving states the flexibility to make that happen is critical to lowering premiums and guaranteeing access for everyone."

It’s eminently responsible for authorities to keep track of violent gang members and, if they’re here illegally, deport them.

Although ten states are pressuring President Trump to phase out DACA by September 5th, ending the program would not make our streets safer or borders more secure.

690,senatortomudall,Democrat,"NAFTA, like many of our trade agreements, could certainly be improved with better protections for American workers and updated to reflect new circumstances. However, any renegotiation of NAFTA must protect the thousands of New Mexicans whose livelihoods depend on stable trade relations with Mexico. Business and economic development leaders in Santa Teresa and across the state have told me that the Trump administration’s brinksmanship, confusion, and alarming rhetoric surrounding NAFTA have already hurt our border economies, placing a cloud of uncertainty over businesses and damaging our relationship with our most important trading partner, Mexico.   As we move forward, Congress, New Mexicans and the American people deserve to have the details about the Trump administration's priorities and intentions for NAFTA renegotiation. Given that NAFTA was implemented by congressional legislation that is now law, any significant change to NAFTA will need to come back to Congress for approval.   U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer pledged to me that he will oppose unilateral withdrawal from NAFTA. He also stated that demands for Mexico to pay for a border wall would doom the chances of a successful NAFTA negotiation. He further committed to giving greater consideration to U.S. businesses – many of which are located in New Mexico’s border region and employ thousands of New Mexicans – in NAFTA renegotiation. I will hold the Trump administration to these commitments, and I will forcefully oppose an adversarial or chaotic approach to updating NAFTA that undermines our critical trade relationship with Mexico.    New Mexico’s border region is one of the bright spots in our state’s struggling economy – but President Trump’s reckless NAFTA posturing threatens that success. Now that NAFTA renegotiation has formally begun, it is imperative that President Trump and Representative Lighthizer visit our border communities to see for themselves what their plans will mean for real New Mexicans and Americans.  https://www.abqjournal.com/1005240/trump-administration-announces-plans-to-renegotiate-nafta.html"

The sooner that the VA can implement sensible disciplinary procedures, the sooner it can focus on its primary mission of providing care for veterans.  I voted for S.1094 — the Department of Veteran Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. This bill — a revised version of the House-passed VA Accountability First Act (H.R.1259) — would shorten the notification and review period for the demotion and removal of employees, while preserving their due process right to file an appeal with an independent agency.  This bill also creates a new, centralized office responsible for handling and protecting whistleblowers, to ensure that bad actors are identified and that veterans receive the quality care they deserve."

702,RepLoisFrankel,Democrat,"The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reveals that 18 million Americans would lose health insurance coverage in the first year after a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. And premiums for people buying individual non-group coverage would double within 10 years! There's more progress to be made with the ACA, but let's build on what we have instead of throwing consumers and the health care industry into chaos.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/17/18-million-would-lose-insurance-in-first-year-of-obamacare-repeal-without-replacement-cbo-report-says/?postshare=6661484670045149&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.bc717fd07e20"

708,RepEliseStefanik,Republican,Today I reintroduced the Lift the Relocation Burden from Military Spouses Act.

The hallway sends a message of respect for veterans to  airport users, visitors, and the local community."
710,derek.kilmer,Democrat,"I voted against the continuing resolution today.  I am disappointed that rather than using these last few weeks to do their jobs and produce a long-term, bipartisan spending plan, the majority of Congress has decided to once again kick the can down the road. I remain committed to working with the members of both parties to pass a long-term, bipartisan spending plan.  Congress has punted from September to early-December, then to mid-December and now to January. No household would run their family finances three weeks at a time. No business would either.  These manufactured crises are certainly no way to run the government either.  That’s why I supported measures like No Budget No Pay, which would mean Congress wouldn’t be paid if the government is shutdown.  In January, Congress should get serious and pass a long-term, bipartisan deal. That’s overdue. Doing so would mean government agencies and the federal workforce has the assurances needed to make long-term plans, which saves taxpayer money, allows the military to maintain readiness, and prevents Americans from having the government services on which they rely held hostage by partisan politics."

715,RepBarbaraComstock,Republican,"Today we passed H.R. 2842, “The Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act,” legislation that links those looking for jobs with employers who have jobs available.

718,stevekingia,Republican,"Including this legislation in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is the right action for the American taxpayer—it preserves the rule of law and provides a significant tax savings.  The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) has estimated that eliminating deductibility for unlawful employment would increase federal tax revenues by approximately $25.4 billion per year, which is $254 billion over 10 years.  This amount more than pays for any increase in the deficit over the limit set by reconciliation."
719,RepBillJohnson,Republican,"I agree with President Trump's decision to declare the opioid crisis a national emergency...because it is one. He has recognized this from before he was elected - he said it many times during his campaign. More federal help is welcome. However, despite today's decision, this is not a problem we as a country are going to be able to arrest, incarcerate, or legislate our way out of. We all have to be in this effort together."

723,SenatorRandPaul,Republican,"Continuing his search for the best health care options, Paul met Mon­­day morning with community leaders in Eliza­bethtown to hear their stories and concerns with health care and to make a push for his association health care plan, which would allow Americans to join large groups across state lines for less expensive health insurance."

726,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"Happy Mother’s Day to everyone celebrating across Rochester and the nation! As a mother of three and grandmother of seven, I know how much these roles have helped shape how I view my responsibilities as a federal legislator. From advocating for affordable health care to fighting for paid family leave and equal pay for equal work, the choices Congress makes day in and day out affects the lives of women, children, and their families. This humbling fact strengthens my resolve to keep working toward a more just world where mothers and all women are valued and respected."
727,CongresswomanClark,Democrat,"Trump's ""trust"" does nothing to ensure he's acting to benefit the American people rather than line his own pockets. The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, introduced with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, mandates a qualified blind trust for Presidents and Vice Presidents."

731,RepStephMurphy,Democrat,"My thoughts are with the innocent victims of today’s attack in New York City and their families, as well as with the NYPD officers—“New York’s Finest”—who responded with characteristic courage.  America will never bend or break in the face of evil."
732,reploudermilk,Republican,"Real stories of the terrible impact of Obamacare from our 11th District neighbors.  “At the age of 61, as our health insurance premiums began to skyrocket, I was forced to take on a second job working 20-25 hours a week in addition to helping run our general contracting business. In 2014, health insurance premiums for my husband and I totaled $289 per month. Today, we are being forced to pay $1757 per month, a total of $21,079 for 2017. In just 3 years, our monthly premiums have increased by over 600%. There is no association for the building industry that offers group plans with a more reasonable rate. We had only one viable option in companies to choose from as other companies have opted out of serving our area.   “In 2017, we will pay more in just health insurance premiums than we will pay for the total of all of the other business and personal insurance coverages we carry, including general liability, workers comp, and vehicle insurance for our business, plus personal auto, home, rental property, and two life insurance policies. Even with my second job, I can’t work enough hours to cover the entirety of our current health insurance premiums.” - Becky, Cartersville, GA"

My heart mourns for innocent, little children whose very life depends on if their families can pay the bills. This is the right and wrong of it.  This is the heart and soul of the matter.   We cannot abandon our principles. Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget our values.    I have fought too hard and too long to back down now.  I will fight any bill that turns the clock back to a darker time.  I will fight every single attempt to turn a deaf ear, a blind eye, and a cold shoulder to the sick, to our seniors, and to working families.  Mr. Speaker, I will fight every day, every hour, every minute, and every second.  I will oppose this bill with every breath and every bone in my body.    We must not give up.  We cannot – I will not -- give in.  Not today, not tomorrow, and never ever.  On this bill, there is only one option – and that option is to vote NO.  You can do better.  Mr. Speaker, you must do better.   Vote no on this bill!"

While many Ohioans will be barbecuing with family, many more will be working - and they deserve honest pay for the hours they put in.   The Administration did the right thing by moving forward with overtime pay. But we can’t let them leave some workers behind. It’s simple – if you work 50 or 60 hours a week, your paycheck should reflect those extra hours.   President Trump made big promises to Ohio workers on the campaign trail and it’s up to him to deliver. 130,000 Ohio workers were promised a long-overdue raise when this rule was announced and the President needs to keep that promise for ALL 130,000 Ohio workers."

These photos show the real people in Syria who have already suffered so much and will continue to suffer even more atrocities if the U.S. allows Russia to continue to enable Assad.

770,Representative.Martha.Roby,Republican,"I'm pleased to report that yesterday President Trump signed the Veterans Choice Act to extend the VA's Choice program and allow veterans to have more access to private care.  This legislation is a strong step forward in making improvements to the VA. It ensures that those who depend on VA health care can access outside providers when wait times are too long or VA facilities are too far away.   While we still have a long way to go in improving the VA, extending the Choice program was the right decision and a necessary step. I'm glad we have a President who is working with Congress to reform the VA rather than standing in our way."
771,janschakowsky,Democrat,"On the eve of a Presidential Inauguration that has many Americans feeling frightened and divided, it is helpful and inspiring to turn our thoughts to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Dr. King, through his actions and words, taught us that great social and civil change can come only through the hard work and determination of individuals. With his example, he demonstrated that it is up to all of us to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Whether we focus our efforts on ending the injustice in our healthcare system, which Dr. King called the “most shocking and inhumane” of all the forms of inequality, or on righting any of the many other wrongs that plague or society, let us aspire to be as peaceful, strong-willed, determined and successful as Martin Luther King, Jr. urged us to be.  ""Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men…We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right."" – Martin Luther King, Jr."

778,RepBillJohnson,Republican,"I applaud President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch has an excellent constitutional background, and was confirmed without any opposition to a seat on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. Few judges in the United States are as qualified as Judge Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court and occupy the seat once held by Justice Scalia. I hope the Senate quickly approves this nomination."

783,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"It’s been more than 150 days since the president took office and still his administration has failed to update the official White House website with the important information Americans need. This includes information about the Violence Against Women Act, a law that I co-authored. Since this law was enacted, the number of domestic violence cases each year has dropped by 67 percent. Millions of people—men and women—need to be able to access the information and services this law provides. The White House should get serious about providing the information Americans expect, from climate change to LGBTQ rights to background about this law.

788,CongressmanRalphAbraham,Republican,"I empathize with the plight of the Dreamers that brought them into our country and recognize that - for the most part - they contribute to society. However, we cannot simply ignore the fact that they are here illegally, nor can we accept unconstitutional policies like DACA.  Congress, not the Executive Branch, writes laws, and President Obama overreached in his authority when he instituted DACA. Knowing that children cannot be blamed for the acts of their parents, we are looking for solutions that will rectify our country’s misguided immigration policy. We will enter into these discussions both with an open mind and also with respect for the rule of law.  This is yet another example of why we need comprehensive immigration reform after we first secure our borders."

803,chrisvanhollen,Democrat,"Thanks to everyone who fought so hard to make sure the Senate did the right thing on health care! Millions of voices from across Maryland and around the country were heard in the Senate Chamber last night when the final vote was cast at 1:40 am. As a result of all the rallies, phone calls, town halls, and emails, we were able to stop Senate Republican efforts that would have resulted in huge price spikes and millions of Americans losing access to affordable care—all to give tax breaks to the powerful few.   While we are relieved, we must remain vigilant. These zombie WealthCare bills have sprung back to life many times over the last seven months. In addition, President Trump has openly revealed that he will use every tool at his disposal to actively sabotage the Affordable Care Act (ACA).   I hope the Republican Senators and President Trump do not go down this road. Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and work together in a bipartisan way to improve health care for all Americans. Many of us have proposed common sense measures to immediately stabilize the Health Care Exchanges, as well as ideas to dramatically improve our overall health care system. The American people have spoken loud and clear. They do not want to reverse the progress we have made—they want to build on it in a way that makes affordable health care available to every American."

Insurers wouldn’t be required to cover essential health benefits that many veterans rely on, like mental health and substance abuse treatment. Worse, veterans would not qualify for the tax credits in this plan, making it more difficult for them to afford coverage. It’s pretty clear we need to go back to the drawing board."

Ignoring radical Islamic terrorism, wishing it away, or regarding it as part and parcel of living in the modern world will not defeat it. We must not limit our mission to defeat radical Islamic terrorism to a discrete set of groups carrying out mass murder, while giving short shrift to the ideology that underpins them and millions around the world who sympathize with that ideology.

836,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"This afternoon, by a vote of 216-212, House Republicans passed their dangerous budget. This was their first step toward enacting a massive, multi-trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthy. There are many awful things in this budget, but one of them hits close to home: the repeal of the State and Local Tax deduction, which ensures families don’t have to pay federal taxes on the taxes they’ve already paid. Repealing the SALT deduction is a political assault on states like New York, where over 65 percent of households with incomes between $50,000 and $200,000 claimed this deduction. Moving forward with the Republican tax plan would raise taxes on hard-working families in our state while subsidizing tax cuts for the wealthy. It’s insulting."

857,RepEliotLEngel,Democrat,"November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month and reminds us that we have more to do to prevent lung cancer.  Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, but fewer Americans are smoking and lung cancer rates are declining. Still, the disease is the number one cause of cancer death. About 220,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the U.S. each year, and more than 155,000 men and women are expected to die of the disease each year.   The biggest way to reduce your risk of lung cancer is to never smoke, or if you do smoke, quit. Smoking is responsible for about 80 percent of lung cancer cases in the U.S. In addition to cigarettes, smoking cigars, pipes, hookah or other tobacco products is harmful. The effects of e-cigarettes on cancer risk are not yet known, so they should not be considered a safe alternative or cessation tool until more research is done.  Although smoking is the main risk factor for lung cancer, secondhand smoke, exposure to radon gas, or occupational exposure to certain toxic substances or radiation may also increase your risk.   Lung cancer symptoms, including a persistent cough, constant chest pain, hoarseness lasting a long time or shortness of breath, don’t usually occur until the disease has progressed. If you are or were a long-time smoker, talk to a health care professional about the pros and cons of low-dose spiral CT screening, which can detect lung cancer at earlier stages, when successful treatment is more likely.   Quitting smoking is not easy due to the highly addictive nicotine found in cigarettes. A health care professional can connect you to resources to help you quit.

870,SenatorBobCasey,Democrat,"By sharing highly classified intelligence with a foreign adversary, President Trump has made our nation less safe. President Trump’s inappropriate disclosure risks exposing the source of this intelligence and the methods by which it was obtained; not only does this endanger the source of the intelligence but it may give our allies caution before sharing vital information with U.S. intelligence agencies. Any president can legally declassify intelligence information.  However, this is not a question of legality. Rather it’s about the appropriate use of highly classified, sensitive intelligence and how to use that intelligence in a manner that will increase the likelihood that the U.S. and our coalition partners will defeat ISIS and keep our country safe. This disclosure to Russian officials undermines that effort."

873,RepSanfordSC,Republican,"A couple hours ago - in between taking votes, I spoke on Fox Business about the continuing debate over the tax bill.  You may have noticed that there’s now talk about the corporate tax cut going to 22% instead of 20%. In my view, this would be a mistake...but it’s probably the direction things are headed. It was the Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman who noted years ago that the best way to affect economic activity came by lowering marginal rates. Not only does it give worker and investor alike added inducement to indeed work and invest, it gets government out of the business of social engineering and picking winners and losers in the commercial marketplace.   The reason there is such a strong lobbying community in and around Washington is in large measure tied to the tax code. Seemingly small exemptions and carve-outs can mean millions of dollars in windfall. The ability to pick winners and losers here gives people in politics more power than they should have and sets in motion a lot of the very dynamics that people detest about Washington and its operations.  So, if you want to take power and authority out of Washington, lower the rate.   But given the tug-of-war that is now taking place between House and Senate versions, and what to leave in and take out, it’s important to remember that for each percentage point that is added back to the corporate rate over 20%, about $100 billion in revenue over 10 years. Eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax costs about $40 billion on the corporate side and about $132 billion on the individual side.Some of the money in question is about this. Another debate point is on the deductibility of interest cost with business. Still another is on the deductibility of state and local taxes at the individual level...and so forth….  The tug-of-war is just beginning and will certainly go through next week...and maybe into the week following. I will keep you posted."

During the debate, my colleague from South Carolina told Ashley to her face that Medicaid expansion did not save her life – demeaning her journey and demonstrating a fundamental lack of understanding of this crisis.

911,aumuaamata,Republican,"Talofa! Today my colleagues in the House Veterans Affairs Committee held a joint hearing with our counterparts in the Senate. The topic was Veterans Service Organizations. Read my press release here:  Washington, D.C. –Wednesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, and the House Veterans Affairs Committee (HVAC), in conjunction with the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, held a series of joint hearings this week, regarding the budget requests of several major Veterans Service Organizations (VSO’s) including, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), the Disabled Veterans of America (DVA), and the American Legion.  “It is always informative when the various VSO’s conduct their annual budget hearings with Congress,” said Amata.  “It allows us the opportunity to hear directly from our veterans on how we can improve the services and care being delivered to those who have sacrificed so much for our nation.  Post 3391 in my home district of American Samoa plays a central role in our local veteran’s lives. Lead by Post Commander Maria B. Vaa-Igafo, their advocacy is critical to ensuring our veterans are being given the same benefits as their counterparts in the states, so I want to thank them back home in Pago Pago for the work they do,” continued the Congresswoman.  The hearings which took place over a week were all filled to capacity with VSO members and their families in the audience, while National Leadership from each organization presented their statement. During the hearings, the VSO’s presented their budget requests, and spoke on some of the improvements that can be made at the VA, in order to ensure that veterans are receiving the benefits they have earned.  Members from each VSO stated their strong belief that the VA should not be privatized, and each VSO also stated their strong support for increased and improved services for our rural veterans to name just a few of the topics discussed.  “I want to thank our veterans and their organizational leadership for their presentations which do a tremendous amount in helping Congress formulate policies and legislation that better serve them.  It is my goal to make sure that our veterans in American Samoa are afforded the same care and benefits as their counterparts in the states, and I won’t stop until that is a reality.  In fact, following the recent CODEL, I expect some real positive changes for our veterans coming very soon,” concluded Amata."

The VA is charged with helping to fulfill that guarantee, especially as it relates to delivering the medical care that veterans need.  I'm troubled by the information that has come to light. The VA must conduct a nationwide review to identify all providers who were known to have had adverse actions taken against their clinical privileges, to include the revocation of state medical licensure, and were subsequently hired by the Department.

The aim of this caucus is to educate members of congress and staff on important issues impacting the Everglades as well as generate support for the projects and funding still needed to complete restoration efforts.  Co-Chair of the Everglades Caucus, Congressman Mario-Diaz Balart said: ""I am glad to welcome Congressman Rooney to the Everglades Caucus. As Co-Chair, I am excited to have another member with the passion and commitment to continue advocating for the restoration of Florida's natural treasure.""  “As Co-Chairman of the Congressional Everglades Caucus, I am pleased to welcome Congressman Francis Rooney to the caucus. While great progress has been made in addressing the challenge of restoring the Everglades, one of the world’s most unique ecological systems, there is still much work to be done. This work can only be accomplished through dedicated, bipartisan efforts. With the addition of Rep. Rooney, the Caucus remains committed to advocating, educating, and finding lasting solutions for one of our nations’ most treasured and important ecosystems,” said Congressman Alcee L. Hastings.  Congressman Francis Rooney stated: “I am proud to join my colleagues in the commitment of Everglades restoration. The Everglades is one of the true ecological wonders of the world. For far too long our community in Southwest Florida has been plagued by water quality and ecological disaster. This has hurt our local economy and has forced businesses to close their doors. This is my number one priority for our community. We need the federal government to do their fair share - that was promised to us.”  Background:  Congressman Francis Rooney has long been an advocate to restore and protect the Everglades. Immediately upon being sworn in to congress on January 3, 2017 he has aggressively pursued educating members on the importance of funding restoration projects. He has personally met with the Army Corps of Engineers, Speaker Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Governor Scott and many other leaders advocating for the appropriation of preauthorized funds."

949,repsheaporter,Democrat,"Today’s estimate by the independent Congressional Budget Office that 14 million Americans would lose their insurance next year under the Republican health plan should be the nail in the coffin for this draconian proposal, which would not only take away Americans’ insurance but also slash Medicaid, end Medicaid expansion, roll back requirements that insurance cover basic medical services, increase deductibles, and raise premiums for older Americans – all while slashing taxes for the wealthiest.   According to CBO, 24 million people would lose their coverage by 2026, meaning the Republican plan not only erases the gains we’ve made since the Affordable Care Act but would actually leave fewer people with coverage than before the law passed.   Now that the Republican health bill’s devastating impact has been laid out in black and white, it’s time for President Trump and Congressional Republicans to join the American people and the health care industry in rejecting this harmful bill, and instead come to the table to find bipartisan solutions that make our health care system work better for everyone."

Kate writes: “In September 2012, at age 24, I left my full-time job at a local nonprofit with great benefits to pursue a masters degree in social work. Frankly, I wasn't too worried - I had always been in good health. But, thanks to the ACA, I was able to go back on my parents' insurance plan, and I started classes in September. I was feeling tired and run down, with a nagging cough, but at 24 it was easy to chalk that up to balancing school and work. That December, I noticed a bump on my collarbone and several swollen lymph nodes.  Despite being sure that it was nothing, my friend convinced me to make an appointment with my doctor.  “It was stage 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma - a blood cancer. In one appointment, my life turned upside down, and soon I was facing biopsies, blood tests, and treatment planning. In January 2013, I began six months of chemotherapy. That June, my scans showed a great response to treatment - but there was still active cancer, so I went on to a month of radiation therapy. In November, I learned that I was finally in remission.   “What stands out to me most is that while I worried a lot that year, and I still worry today - about recurrence, long-term side effects, and survivorship - what I never had to worry about, thanks to the ACA, was being denied treatment for lack of resources or insurance. I didn't have to worry about the long term implications of my ""pre-existing condition."" No person, cancer patient or otherwise, should ever have to fear that the scariest time in their life could be made even harder by leaders who do not value health care as a basic human right.”  You can share a story of how the #AffordableCareAct has impacted the lives of you and your family here: http://bit.ly/2kk6Sv8"

This bill includes vital military construction funds necessary to Texas installations, increases the number of F-35s to ensure the continuation of our air superiority and begins the much-needed rebuilding of our military. This bill also provides a well-deserved pay increase to our brave Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines who defend our nation and freedoms every day.  Beyond Texas, the environment overseas for the United States remains volatile, dangerous, and unpredictable. After eight years of a foreign policy geared toward appeasing America’s enemies and ignoring America’s friends, it is imperative for the United States to reassure our partners that we will stand with them in the face of current and emerging threats.

I intend to hold the VA and Administration accountable for following through on these changes and improving care for the men and women who have served our nation in uniform.

So it’s just another extension of their aggressiveness in pursuing these interests. With respect to Cuba, Cuba has always had long standing, very capable intelligence capabilities and I don’t see a reduction in those capabilities.”  We must not stand idly by while our adversaries construct an intelligence apparatus in our backyard that poses a significant threat to U.S. national security. We shall stand resolute in our commitment to deter Russian aggression and prevent their malign influence from metastasizing in foreign countries."

Beginning in 2018, workers will be able to keep more of their paycheck, business investment and job creation will boom, and salaries will rise.  Importantly, we were able to secure important wins in the final version of the bill based on feedback from Kentuckians to protect Berea College, spur investment in the horse industry, make our signature bourbon industry more competitive, encourage more international investment in the Commonwealth, and help Kentuckians pay off their student loans and medical expenses.  After nearly a decade of sluggish economic growth, lost opportunities, and low confidence, America is making a comeback.

This week, in Congress, we will pass bills to sanction Iran’s Ballistic Missile Program as well as Hezbollah and, as the President announced, we will also sanction Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). I’m proud to say that I have introduced legislation on several occasions, including earlier this year that adds, even more, pressure to the regime by designating the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization.   Winning this ideological struggle is very personal to me.   My father was a bombardier in WWII and participated in the D-Day campaign. He bombed the Nazis. What my father and their generation were fighting against was pure evil. It is no surprise that the radical Islamists were allies of the Nazis.

Five or six million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico, more than all the European countries combined, and Trump’s anger and short-sightedness is going to hurt America bigly.  It starts with President Peña-Nieto’s cancelling his trip, but it is going to get a lot worse and we Americans are going to feel it in our wallets.""  [Posted by staff http://bit.ly/2kyn07W]"

1149,RepLujanGrisham,Democrat,"These cowardly threats against Jewish community centers have no place in our society. It troubles me that so many people are emboldened by the current political climate to target their fellow Americans with hate speech and threats of violence based on their own prejudices and ignorance. I stand with New Mexico’s Jewish community in denouncing today’s threats. Likewise, I stand with Muslims in New Mexico and all minorities who are anxious about the President’s anti-immigrant and anti-refugee executive orders. We are better than this. New Mexico is inclusive and welcoming of all people, and I will do everything possible to fight against hateful rhetoric and actions that don’t represent our values. http://krqe.com/2017/01/31/albuquerque-police-investigate-bomb-threat-at-jewish-community-center/"

1153,CongressmanGarretGraves,Republican,"Service Academy Nominee Highlight! Every year, our office is given the opportunity to nominate Louisiana high school seniors to United States Service Academies.    In 2016, Aleah Harris came to our office for a Congressional nomination and was given the opportunity to attend the United States Air Force Academy’s Prep School.  After a successful year there, she was granted another nomination and will soon attend the United States Air Force Academy full-time.    When Aleah arrived to the AFA Prep School, she wad disappointed to learn that there were not enough lady players to form a women’s soccer team, but she was soon given the opportunity to join the men’s team where she excelled.  She also excelled in trig/pre-calculus and was in the top 10% of her class for overall physical fitness. This year, she has made time management a priority and is thankful for the bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood that she has formed at the prep school.   Aleah wanted to recommend that all students interested in attending an academy do their research on each of them and start preparing for the application and physical fitness exam as soon as possible. Over the next four years. Aleah plans to ""embrace every aspect of life at the Air Force Academy and to learn as much as I can.""  She is majoring in Computer Sciences and hopes to pursue a career in special investigation after graduation. Good luck Aleah! Continue to make us proud!  Service Academy nomination applications are currently being accepted from students throughout the Sixth Congressional District who are interested in attending one of our Nation’s prestigious Service Academies.  Deadline is October 30th.   Learn more here: https://garretgraves.house.gov/services/military-academy-nominations"

1164,RepBonnie,Democrat,"For me I am concerned about the segregation that takes place in our schools and the intending lack of resources that seem to correlation with that whether or not this segregation is intentional or de facto, it is something that we need to eliminate. We need somebody in charge who is going to understand all of our children have the right to a good education and we need that person to understand that public education is not a privilege, it is a right. And that the reason we have public education is because public education wasn’t always available to minorities and poor people."

The impressive team from RIT spent months designing their device and will travel to Houston this week to put their prototypes to the test in the JSC’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory– a 6.2-million-gallon pool used to simulate microgravity for astronaut spacewalk training.

1174,RepTomSuozzi,Democrat,"The biggest problem in America today is partisan division. Partisanship is caused because over 400 of the 435 seats in The House of Representatives are ""safe"" seats.  If you are a Republican in a Republican safe seat or a Democrat in a Democratic safe seat, you can't lose the general election. You can only lose a primary.   Few people vote in primaries (often under 10% of the registered voters in each party) and the few that do vote are often far to the right for Republicans and far to the left for Democrats. So incumbents in safe seats spend a great deal of effort pleasing the base of their party faithful that vote in primaries.  It gets very difficult to compromise if you are set on only pleasing your base.  The only way to solve this problem is to have less safe seats. The only way to have less safe seats is to get rid of partisan gerrymandering. One of the only ways to get rid of partisan gerrymandering is to have the Supreme Court declare it unconstitutional.  I am one of 36 members and former members of Congress (half Dems and half Reps) that have signed on to a ""friend of the Court) brief to be argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

1176,UsRepRickNolan,Democrat,"The President’s decision to pursue this futile and seemingly endless 17-year war in Afghanistan is deeply disappointing and disturbing. If there is one Trump campaign promise the American people agree with, it’s putting a stop to endless wars of choice that are costing us so much precious American blood and treasury – and reinvesting those resources in America and our people. The simple fact is that this conflict in Afghanistan has become America’s longest war. It is bleeding us to death. This is a sad day, and the Chinese and the Russians are laughing at our costly and tragic folly."

1179,RepJimBanks,Republican,"Today I introduced my first bill as a U.S. Congressman, the VISA Act of 2017. This bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to review the social media of all visa applicants.  We must have confidence that those entering our country do not intend us harm. Directing Homeland Security to review visa applicants’ social media before granting them access to our country is common sense.

I also questioned why we are always the ones to respond, and why the international community may come late, but never early or on time, to these situations.    Russia should have enforced the agreement struck in 2013 to remove all chemical weapons from Syria.  After another attack on innocent civilians, it is clear this did not happen, and a war crime was committed.  I hope President Trump will seek legislative support for any possible future actions."

As he was aboard a night mission during the Vietnam War, Sgt. Levitow’s aircraft was struck by a round of explosives. In order to combat the attack, members aboard the aircraft began launching activated flares to be able to see the enemy and prepare ground troops for attack. However, due to the enemy attack—a member on board the aircraft dropped one of these magnesium flares. Even though Sgt. Levitow was severely wounded from the explosion, he made a split second decision to throw himself on the flare in order to protect others if it were to detonate. Thankfully, he was able to throw it outside of the aircraft right before it was activated. Through this action he demonstrated true American courage and became one of only two enlisted airmen to win the Medal of Honor. It is on this day we remember him—and all of those in our armed forces who make the ultimate sacrifices so that we can live free."

1220,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"Absolutely unacceptable that Republican obstructionism is threatening to leave 400,000 Texas children without health insurance. Now Greg Abbott’s team is pleading for a federal emergency grant of $90 million to keep this program going while his Republican buddies in DC delay. Many Texas families could get less than a lump of coal this year--just three days before Christmas their children would lose health coverage. Instead of working to continue the Children’s Health Insurance Program on a bipartisan basis, the Republican Congress put our children’s health so far down their priority list that they got left off entirely.   And amazingly, if Abbott runs out of CHIP federal funding, his Administration plans to ask families to turn to the Affordable Care Act marketplace for relief—that would be a life preserver from the same Obamacare that Texas Republicans have constantly denounced. They should be ashamed at how cruel this is to these worried families."

They have been driven out of the industries – journalism, entertainment, and yes, Congress – in which they had worked for years to excel. Every individual is entitled to a workplace safe from harassment and abuse. Together we can and will meet this challenge.

While there are differences between the two bills that Republicans are trying to work out, nonpartisan economists have already shown that when you add the different provisions up, the Ryan-McConnell plan raises taxes on millions of middle-class families. To make matters worse, the Senate version also undermines our healthcare system, driving up premiums for working families – all to give a kick-back to wealthy donors, Washington special interests, and corporations that ship jobs overseas.  I want middle-class families and small businesses to get a tax cut, so I will keep fighting for real tax reform."
1231,reploudermilk,Republican,"Federal bureaucracies are often more interested in making new regulations than making sure the ones they have are kept up to date. The Bank Secrecy Act was created in 1970 to combat money laundering for criminal and terroristic purposes; however, it has not kept up with the times. One Georgia bank has 21 full-time employees whose job it is to ensure compliance with this one regulation. Now is the time to bring common sense back to Washington. #fixingDC"
1232,SenatorCortezMasto,Democrat,"As someone who was born and raised in Nevada, I had the benefit of a father who loved the outdoors. He took my sister and I camping and hiking everywhere he could, so that we, too, could experience and grow a love for the outdoors. Why should we take that away from anyone else who should, and deserve the right, to have that same experience?   What we’re fighting for are our parks and our national monuments, and right now, President Donald J. Trump and Secretary Ryan Zinke are considering rescinding the pristine and beautiful areas of Nevada’s Gold Butte and Basin and Range National Monuments. This is about Nevadans right to enjoy their public lands for outdoor recreation for generations to come."

The bill will quadruple the time - from 6 to 24 months - a designated country must refrain from sponsoring terrorism, before a President, regardless of party, can remove it from the sponsor list. The bill also increases congressional oversight by doubling the time Congress has to review the President’s proposed removal--from 45 to 90 days.   By increasing the amount of time for a state to show they are not engaged in terrorism and increasing congressional oversight and scrutiny, we will force countries to prove they are not bad actors Read my statement below."

According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Irma is an extremely dangerous Category 5 hurricane with winds of 175 mph moving closer to the Caribbean.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico early Wednesday, with hurricane conditions arriving later that day.

A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.      History shows that storm tracks can change quickly and unexpectedly.  Residents and visitors in areas potentially affected by the severe weather should continue to monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information, and follow the instructions of state, local, and tribal officials.    Be familiar with evacuation routes, have a family communications plan, keep a battery-powered radio handy and have a plan for pets.

1319,RepLowenthal,Democrat,"It is hard to digest the controversies that seem to flow out of the White House on an almost daily basis. However, we cannot lose sight of the most critical issue: what did Russia do during the election, and in the course of their efforts, who helped them? If the Trump campaign was involved—if there was collusion—then all these bad actors need to be prosecuted.    But that doesn’t change the absolutely critical goal of addressing what Russia did. If we do not—if there are no repercussions to a foreign power who meddled in our election—it will only embolden them to use the same playbook again and again. And other foreign powers will learn from Russia’s example that attacking our democracy is an effective way to undermine us as a nation and diminish our leadership in the world.    I believe a final resolution is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. But, I have no doubt that in the end, the truth will come out."

A good analysis of some of the false arguments being deployed by Trump and others is in this article by America's Voice: http://bit.ly/2eIeP8y  THEY MIGHT SAY: DACA is unconstitutional. We were forced to end it.    WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS: Despite the long history of presidents of both parties implementing similar policies, and thedeep well of legal analysis proving DACA is legal, does anyone really believe this President and his team have conducted a careful constitutional analysis about the extent of executive authority to reach this decision? Greg Sargent of the Washington Post obliterates this notion in a powerful piece. With tongue in cheek, he writes. “It is a truly shocking coincidence that the same advisers who are telling Trump that DACA is unconstitutional were also the ones most responsible for the disguised Muslim ban and also pushed Trump to pardon Joe Arpaio.”  THEY MIGHT SAY: We’re doing this to focus on criminals.    WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS: If talk of MS-13 and “bad hombres” is scary, maybe Americans won’t notice that this Administration is actually going after the easy targets – young people who are going to college, starting businesses, paying taxes and using their educations to grow the economy; immigrants who are complying with ICE orders of supervision and showing up at ICE offices for “check-ins;” and immigrants who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are arrested as “collaterals.”"

1331,senatoralfranken,Democrat,"During Betsy DeVos’ confirmation hearing a couple weeks ago, it became quickly apparent that she didn’t understand even the most basic issues in education. I found that very troubling—especially for somebody nominated to run our Education Department—and a whole lot of other people found it troubling as well.   I have received nearly 20,000 letters from Minnesotans weighing in on her nomination. Virtually all of them—some 99 percent—voiced opposition. I have also received nearly 3,000 phone calls from constituents. Fewer than 15 of them said they thought she should be the Secretary of Education.   (Quick aside: never think that calling your elected officials doesn’t make a difference. It does.)   Now, just this weekend, I was in Minneapolis having dinner with former Vice President Walter Mondale. We went in to the kitchen to meet the restaurant workers, and one of the guys turned to me and told me to vote against DeVos. It doesn't take being an educator to realize that she doesn't have what it takes to do this job.   Minnesotans deserve an Education Secretary who understands and champions public education and who can successfully address the challenges that families face every day when it comes to their kids’ education. Betsy DeVos is not that candidate. Today I voted against her in the Education Committee and I'll be sure to vote against her when her name comes up for confirmation on the Senate Floor."

1337,SenatorShaheen,Democrat,"The Affordable Care Act protects Americans by preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, like Ellie McCabe. Families like the McCabes shouldn’t be forced to choose between life-saving procedures and a lifetime of serious debt, but their healthcare is in jeopardy as Republican leadership negotiates healthcare repeal behind closed doors. I’ll continue to urge my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats to preserve these critical healthcare protections and increase access to affordable care. – J.S."
1338,congressmanpittenger,Republican,"Good credit can be life changing.  Yet millions of Americans lack a credit score not because they aren’t responsible, but because the system makes them invisible.  Today, the House Committee on Financial Services unanimously approved my legislation (in partnership with Congressman Keith Ellison) to allow utilities, telecom companies, and landlords to report on-time payment data to credit reporting agencies, enabling families with little or no credit to build credit scores on their own merit.   This truly bipartisan effort could end credit invisibility.  Watch my remarks to the House Financial Services Committee to learn more."

I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R.2282, the Equality Act, legislation recently introduced in Congress that would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity among the prohibited categories of discrimination.   Although we continue to make momentous strides toward equality, the Trump Administration and many of my Republican colleagues have turned a blind eye towards the needs of the LGBT community in the United States and around the world. While we still face many challenges, I will always be an advocate for equality and justice in the LGBT community. I encourage my colleagues in Congress and all Americans to join me in doing so. This month, I am proud to recognize and celebrate LGBT Pride Month."

1345,SenatorShaheen,Democrat,"The Chinese government recently awarded President Trump 38 trademarks for various business dealings which comes after years of unsuccessful filing efforts by Trump’s legal team. These trademarks to market the Trump name for profit in China were announced shortly after President Trump spoke with President Xi Jinping and affirmed the continuation of the United States’ One-China policy. The timing of these trademarks raises serious ethical concerns. The U.S. Constitution forbids the President and other office holders from accepting foreign payments without authorization by Congress. President Trump’s ongoing failure to resolve his conflicts of interest and divest himself from his business entanglements creates serious trust issues. The Office of Government Ethics needs to weigh in on whether the award betrays ethics laws, policies, or established norms.

1351,RepBradWenstrup,Republican,"I support President Trump’s commitment to American strength in Afghanistan, and his focus on the threats that face the United States of America, as well as the victory and accountability of our allies.  As we have seen in the past, withdrawing too soon only leaves a void that the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and ISIS are all too eager to fill. Operating based on conditions on the ground rather than political promises will lead to a victory for our troops, America, and our allies.  President Trump declared that we as a country “always face down evil.” When that is our common purpose, we succeed."

That's why today I joined South Kitsap School District leadership, teachers, para educators, and members of the community to discuss what the Administration's proposed budget could mean for our community. From slashing career and technical education to cutting funding to help low income students get a leg up, it's clear that this proposal hurts our ability to give every student an equal opportunity.

We also continue to remember and thank the brave first responders who saved countless lives while risking, and in many cases, sacrificing their own, as well as the men and women of our armed forces who serve to keep us safe.   Let us never forget that fateful day and the lives lost, but also how our nation came together and united against fear and hate.  We live in the greatest country in the world and we will never give in to those who threaten our freedoms.  May God Bless America."

1369,RepJohnLarson,Democrat,"The Republican tax bill introduced yesterday is a direct assault on Connecticut’s middle class. Connecticut residents already pay more in federal taxes, than the state receives back in federal funding.  With this proposal the Connecticut middle-class will be paying even more. A middle-class family in Connecticut that owns a home will see an average tax increase of $800 a year (http://news.americansagainstdoubletaxation.org/press-releases/new-data-brady-tax-plan-with-partial-salt-elimination-would-raise-taxes-on-middle-class-homeowners-by-as-much-as-26/).  Hard working, blue collar families will continue to bear the burden of high taxes while corporations and their executives will see immense benefits. This bill was constructed in back rooms with not only the Democrats kept in the dark, but the majority of the Republican party as well. They have neglected to conduct hearings and listen to testimony, a far cry from regular order, and the Republican leadership are trying to jam this through solely for a political win – at the expense of the middle class and the Northeast. We have to find solutions that work for everyone and in order to do that, all parties must be at the table. Read my release here:"

Integrity is more than just a word to service members, so I know if we say we’ll look out for each other and ourselves, we’ll do it. This Oath of Exit is a strong step forward in doing anything and everything we can to prevent even one more veteran from harming themselves."

1418,RepMarkWalker,Republican,"I despise bringing any awareness to such despicable behavior; however, such hate needs to be rebuked. The KKK rally planned for May in Randolph County is a reminder of the hateful ideologies that exists within a minuscule group.  The Scriptures state 'anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.’ This darkness is saturated in ignorance, denying that God has created every man, woman, boy and girl uniquely with exceptional skills and talent.  The rally may be constitutional, but this group's message and legacy are an affront to our core value that all people are created equal. I would hope the people of North Carolina reject this behavior not with violence, but with actions that represent genuine love for all in our community."

1420,CongressmanJodyHice,Republican,"In November, I’m thrilled to be hosting two veteran-focused events in the 10th District. On Friday, November 10th, I encourage our local heroes to stop by my Monroe District Office between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. for an appreciation coffee. While there, we will also discuss important issues facing our military and veterans.   On Saturday, November 18th, I’m working with U.S. Senator David Perdue, Jefferson County, and community partners to host a Helping Our Heroes event. Veterans are invited to enjoy a continental breakfast and turkey giveaway, while learning more information about filing claims, housing, benefits, suicide prevention, support for those with disabilities, employment, and more.  I firmly believe that we must honor the generations of men and women who wore the uniform for protecting our freedom. Although one event is not enough to express our debt of gratitude, I hope that our local heroes will know how grateful we are for their service and that we always will hold them in the highest regard.  The following organizations will participate in the event to support our local veterans: American Legion Department of Georgia, Augusta Warrior Project, Augusta Vet Center, Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Georgia Department of Veterans Service, Jefferson County Vets in Action, Jefferson Hospital, and Tools for Life. For more information, please call at (478) 457-0007 or email Jessica.hayes@mail.house.gov."

1426,chrisvanhollen,Democrat,"Why are Senate Republicans drafting their health care bill in secret? They are clearly afraid the American people will hate what they see.  In 2009, the Senate spent 25 days publicly debating the details of the Affordable Care Act before passing the bill. But Senate Republican efforts to draft a Trumpcare 2.0 bill have been shrouded in unprecedented secrecy. They have been meeting behind closed doors and in private lunch, groups to haggle over a new health care bill. Then they plan to rush their legislation straight to the Senate floor for a vote before the July 4th with no opportunity for Democrats, or the public, to review the details in Committee hearings or markup—and without even releasing the text of the updated health care bill until the last possible minute.  Americans' health care is too important to ram it through the Senate under cover of darkness. Every citizen should demand an end to the secret meetings and ask Republicans senators why they are hiding their work from their constituents."

A dedicated public servant and a champion of civic engagement and equal rights, Congressman Garcia worked tirelessly in elected office on behalf of New Yorkers and was an advocate for equality and equitable treatment for all people.  He was a founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and was a champion of civil rights.  He notably worked with members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to establish legislation that created the national holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   Congressman Garcia made a significant impact to our community and was a pioneer for Hispanics in the political arena.

1507,UsRepRickNolan,Democrat,"Today, GOP leadership took one more step towards passing their terrible budget--which gives tax breaks to billionaires at the expense of the middle class.  As I’ve said, there are three things any budget or tax reform plan's got to do to get my vote:  1) Benefit working families. 2) Ensure that the rich pay their fair share. 3) Create good paying jobs.  The simple fact is, this budget fails the test on all three measures. It hurts working families, gives huge tax breaks to the rich, makes cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and destroys investment in good paying jobs.   Most of all, this budget fails to show the gratitude we owe for a century of American progress. It cuts the fundamental programs that enabled America to become the great Nation that it is, with doubled life expectancy, investments in infrastructure, technology, and medicine, and the strongest middle class the world has ever seen.   We've got a lot to be grateful for. I'll continue the fight for a better budget and tax system that benefits the middle class, and pays our progress forward towards a new century of American achievement and advancement.  https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/house-passes-budget-resolution-paving-way-tax-package/?utm_source=news-alert&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletters"
1508,RepSanfordSC,Republican,"I wanted to highlight an article published in The Wall Street Journal, which makes a point about economic growth that is rarely made yet needs to be highlighted…because in fact what it talks about is a big - even huge deal...for all of us.  An economy’s ability to grow is roughly limited by the number of people working and how much economic output each of them produces on average. The combined growth rate of those two factors - labor force size and labor productivity - determines an economy’s potential growth rate under ideal conditions of full employment and maximum efficiency of labor.   And why does this matter?    Today, the White House unveiled its budget request for fiscal year 2018, and it assumes an annual GDP growth rate of 3% over the coming decade.    If we get that number, all is good. If we don't, we are left with big budget deficits.    I would argue this number is unrealistic for a number of reasons. But, for now, let me give you just one point on growth itself. The Congressional Budget Office projects a potential economic growth rate of 1.8% per year. This figure reflects the sum of projected annual growth rates for the labor force, 0.5%, and for labor productivity, 1.3%. Achieving a sustainable rate of economic growth significantly higher than 1.8% would therefore require an equally significant increase in the growth rates of either the labor force or labor productivity...or both.   On the projected growth rate in our labor force, the downward trend observed over recent years will prove difficult to reverse. Ten thousand people a day are retiring in our country as the baby boomer generation continues to retire.    It would take a near magical transformation then in our labor productivity to boost overall economic growth  - and that is what this article shows is difficult.    Take a read - this point will prove to be a very important one in the debate ahead on the budget."

As a doctor who has spent my career standing up for patients, I remain deeply concerned that, for Americans suffering under Obamacare’s mandates, the worst days are yet to come. Already, one-third of the counties in the country have only one company offering insurance and some Americans have no plan at all to choose from. Today’s legislation wasn’t able to complete the mission, but I remain committed to freedom of choice and patient-centered care – and continuing the process to get to both."

Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 3898, the “Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act,” which imposes secondary sanctions with respect to North Korea in order to cut off Pyongyang’s ability to finance its weapons programs. Specifically the bill:  • Require the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit, or impose strict conditions on, correspondent or payable-through accounts held in the U.S. by foreign financial institutions that knowingly deal with a “covered person”;  • Prohibits U.S. financial institutions, and persons owned or controlled by such institutions, from knowingly engaging in transaction benefitting covered persons;  • Requires the U.S. to oppose loans by the international financial institutions (i.e. IMF and multilateral development banks) for countries that knowingly fail to prevent the provision of financial services to certain covered persons, as well as deny Export-Import Bank assistance for exports to covered persons;  • Requires regular Treasury updates on sanctions implementation and the Department’s efforts to strengthen the capacity of financial institutions and foreign governments to prevent financing for covered persons; and  • Strengthens IMF technical assistance to improve countries’ efforts in anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)."

1533,MartinHeinrich,Democrat,"Steve Bannon, who made a career out of selling hateful and divisive propaganda aimed at women, Hispanics, African Americans, Jews, and other minorities, was outrageously placed on the National Security Council by President Trump. This unprecedented move not only showed that President Trump trusted the former leader of the far-right website Breitbart News more than our leading generals and his appointed leader of the intelligence community, but could have also compromised the national security decision making process and put American lives at risk at home and abroad.  No matter what his role is, Steve Bannon’s damaging influence on this administration should not be underestimated and is apparent in the actions President Trump has taken in his first days in office. Steve Bannon has rightly been demoted and removed from the National Security Council, but he never should have been there in the first place."

These malicious attacks on places of worship, community centers, and on sacred burial grounds must be investigated with urgency and those who committed these crimes must be held accountable.

1543,repdavereichert,Republican,"Today we moved one step closer to reducing violent crime and making our communities safer for all Americans. This afternoon, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced their initiative for combatting violent crime using Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program I have long championed, as its centerpiece. After years of calling for increased support for PSN under the previous Administration, the DOJ has taken the right step to better protect the American people. From my time in law enforcement, I have seen PSN deliver on reducing violent crime, including gun crime and gang-related activity. It is a results-driven and community outreach-focused program that sends a clear message to potential criminals that if they do the crime, they will do the time.  I am also pleased to see the DOJ has taken hiring shortages seriously and strengthened support for the COPS Hiring Program. I have fought for this program since my first day in Congress. Over the years, our law enforcement officers have taken on more responsibilities, suffered increased public scrutiny, and have been forced to work with fewer resources, making fulfilling their mission of keeping our families safe increasingly difficult. Putting more highly-trained, compassionate, and community-sensitive cops on the street will free up resources for law enforcement departments to tackle violent crime in our communities through community policing and intervention efforts."

I’m proud to be an original author of this landmark legislation, which has reduced the rate of domestic violence by 67% since 1994. It is unconscionable to me that any member of Congress would vote against protecting sexual assault survivors once, let alone three times. I’m also especially disappointed that in the hearing today, Senator Sessions refused to say whether he would hire a special prosecutor if the President-elect or his family violates insider trading laws like the STOCK Act, a law I also wrote to hold federal officials accountable. As a member of the House of Representatives, I don’t vote on cabinet nominations but I feel strongly that we should #StopSessions!"

1622,RepMcEachin,Democrat,"The United States needs to seek strong, enforceable labor standards in a renegotiated NAFTA. Too many American workers have lost well-paying, middle-class jobs because other countries have lower wages and fewer workplace protections. Current policy creates incentives for companies like Mondelēz to offshore jobs to Mexico and elsewhere, adversely affecting countless families and communities. Instead of rewarding offshoring, we need to encourage domestic investments that strengthen our economy and grow the middle class."

As a CPA with 30 years of business experience, reforming our tax code has been my mission since arriving to Washington.  My hope is that these principles will help grow consensus and drive tax reform to the President’s desk.”   The Resolution affirms the commitment of the United States House of Representatives to simplify the tax code for all Americans.  Ten principles:  1. Make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand 2. Raise the standard deduction, increase child tax credits, and lower tax rates 3. Create cuts that touch all individuals and leverage higher rates of economic stimulus 4. Stop special interests from winning at the expense of the middle class 5. Make America the best place in the world to hire, invest, and grow 6. Support family business by eliminating the “Death Tax” 7. Retool the tax code to give American workers a level playing field with foreign competition 8. Switch to a territorial system that encourages companies to bring their profits back home 9. Encourage following regular order to ensure the greatest likelihood of success 10. Encourage all Americans to call on Congress and demand to put America first  You can read more and find full text here: http://bit.ly/2ytlITy  Here is the Resolution on its way to the Cloakroom:"

1629,95696782238.0,Democrat,"President Trump’s intention to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement is an irresponsible renouncement of American leadership. The results of abandoning this international framework will be tragic, destructive, and costly, and will undermine the legitimacy of our country on the global stage.   The United States cannot allow its foreign policy to be dictated by irrational nationalistic whims. The 195 signatory Paris Agreement was reached after painstaking negotiations.  In signing, our country honored its commitment to leave future generations with a better world. Climate change is real, and we know what causes it. The Paris Agreement commits governments to working together to cap pollution levels and combat carbon emissions, which will reduce extreme climate events like drought, famine, and rising sea levels.   Ignoring our international responsibilities jeopardizes the health and future of our country.  President Trump needs to recognize that he is the President for all Americans, not just the privileged few.   This destructive and short-sighted decision will have serious consequences, and the President should be held accountable for his irresponsible actions."

Housing is one of the most basic human needs, and studies show stable housing helps lead to better employment, better health, and a better overall quality of life.

The White House contacted our office on Thursday and we negotiated throughout the night adding four major amendments to this legislation. There remains items of improvement to the bill and we will continue working to lead these efforts. Here's a brief report and summary from the Daily Signal:  ""Trump said he agreed to 'certain changes' to the bill dealing with the Medicaid expansion. Specifically, the president and members of the group agreed to give states the option to implement work requirements on those enrolled in Medicaid and the option to change Medicaid to a block grant program.   They also agreed to add a provision ensuring the tax credits implemented under the plan can’t be used to pay for abortions.  'The president and the vice president have called a group of conservatives from the U.S. House of Representatives and asked us for our support to move the American Health Care Act forward,' Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker, R-N.C., told reporters after the meeting. 'We’re honored to be here to represent the conservatives and to work with the president and vice president for all communities of the American people.""  I admire the heart and spirit of Vice President Pence and pray he can encourage the president to adopt a more gracious tone in reaching out to all in our community."

1697,RepCharlieCrist,Democrat,"Pinellas residents may now apply for federal disaster assistance for uninsured and underinsured damage and losses resulting from #HurricaneIrma.Registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov is the quickest way to register for federal assistance, including FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance. If you do not have access to the internet, you may register by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362).  You should apply for assistance even if you have insurance because you may discover that you still have unmet needs after you receive your settlement. More tips from FEMA below:  • If you have not contacted your insurance agent to file a claim, do so right away. Insurance is your main source for money to put your life, home and business back in order after a disaster.   • Insurance may not cover all post-disaster expenses, so disaster programs may be able to help.   • Don’t wait for your insurance settlement to apply for a low-interest disaster loan from the SBA.   • If your home or its contents are damaged and you are uninsured or underinsured, a FEMA inspector may contact you after you apply to schedule a time to meet with you at your damaged home. All inspectors carry a photo ID that shows they are affiliated with the U.S. government.  • Floridians who applied for disaster assistance after Hurricane Irma should read their letters from FEMA carefully. Sometimes you may need to provide additional information to be eligible for assistance. More information about eligibility and determination letters can be found at fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/07/fact-sheet-questions-about-your-determination-letter."

1719,rfrelinghuysen,Republican,"More Accessible Health Care for Northwest New Jersey Veterans  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Veterans from Sussex County and surrounding areas of northwest New Jersey will soon have another location to receive health care from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), according to U.S. Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen (NJ-11).  The VA says it now expects to open a Community Based Outpatient health care Clinic (CBOC) in Newton on January 9 at 222 High Street.  A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony will be scheduled shortly thereafter.   “For over two years, I have been working with my Congressional colleagues, Sussex Freeholders, state legislators and veterans leaders to bring greater access to health care to veterans in Sussex County by convincing the VA to establish a community health clinic,” said Frelinghuysen. “Of course, there have been bureaucratic obstacles along the way, but we would not back down in our efforts to get VA to do its job to serve those who have served us in uniform.”  The Newton clinic will be open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  Previously, Frelinghuysen was instrumental in the establishment of a veterans outpatient clinic in Morris Township.  The VA's New Jersey Health Care System consists of two main “campuses"" in East Orange and Lyons in Bernards Township with additional satellite clinics in Elizabeth, Hackensack, Hamilton, Jersey City, Paterson, Piscataway and Tinton Falls. Many veterans from Sussex County now use the Morris Township clinic - more than an hour's drive from parts of the county.  Financial support for the Sussex CBOC will be provided through the annual Military Construction-VA Appropriations bill drafted by Frelinghuysen’s House Appropriations Committee.  This legislation provides advanced funding for veterans health care, fully funds veterans’ benefits and programs and contains the dollars to house, train, and equip military personnel, provide housing and services to our troops’ families, and help maintain military base infrastructure.  -30-"

It did, however, make a good start in that direction. It repealed the individual and employer mandates. It repealed almost all of the ACA taxes. It defunded Planned Parenthood. It put in place a mechanism to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid spending. The bill also repealed the federal mandate on essential health benefits.

The plan, of course, deals sweet payoffs to Donald Trump, the Tax-Avoider-in-Chief, and to his family. It abolishes the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is the only reason Trump paid any taxes at all in the one year we know of in which he actually paid taxes over the last two decades. The plan also abolishes the estate tax, which must make the Trump children and other billionaire heirs giddy with excitement, but this elitist proposal has nothing to do with the vast majority of Marylanders because it only applies to the richest one-half of one percent of the nation, a few thousand families. Meantime, the GOP ""plan"" knocks the daylights out of Maryland families because it wipes out the state and local tax deduction. This means that the Republicans not only want to give hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country--blowing up the deficit and the national debt to record levels--but they want to impose taxes on taxes for the middle class, abolishing the federal tax deduction for the state and local taxes we pay for our schools, our roads, our public services. Hundreds of thousands of Marylanders are going to end up paying a lot more in federal taxes because of this cynical sleight-of-hand. For the fat-cat big-oil lobbyists who dine at the Trump Hotel and golf at the Trump golf courses, the GOP plan piles on tax break after tax break. For the working people of Maryland, it piles taxes on taxes.  Take this appalling mess back to Mar-a-Lago."

What will he do next?”  Washington, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland Security, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, and a Member of the House Budget Committee released the following statement:  “New information has just been released that Trump associates may have coordinated with the Russians in the campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Today an enormous breach took place when the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee violated all protocols and maybe even the law by reporting classified information to persons who may be under active investigation.    “On Monday, March 21, FBI Director James Comey appeared before the House Intelligence Committee and testified that there was no substance and no truth to the representations of Donald Trump that President Obama had “wiretapped” Donald Trump. And today, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee may have figuratively blew up his bipartisan committee’s investigation of Trump’s accusation that he had been wiretapped by order of President Obama and undermined the credibility of the committee’s inquiry into the activities of the Russian Government to influence the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election and the possible collusion of Trump campaign associates in those Russian activities.   “It is clear that confidence in the government must be restored, and that an independent investigation into these matters must go forward. Whether Chairman Nunes should continue to lead that investigation, however, should be conditioned on his providing a satisfactory explanation of his conduct to the members of the Intelligence Committee and to the House of Representatives.   “The allegations under investigation by the Intelligence Committee may bear upon high crimes and misdemeanors and should be taken extremely seriously. The investigation must be factual, impartial, thorough, and unbiased.  The American people deserve the truth.” ###  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is a Democrat from Texas’s 18th Congressional District.

1746,RepThomasMassie,Republican,"Tomorrow the House considers HR 1039, a bill to expand the arrest powers of federal probation officers without a warrant.  Currently probation officers can only arrest people on probation without a warrant.  This bill allows them to arrest others without a warrant.  FreedomWorks opposes this bill and so do I.  Here is their statement:  Although the bill may have good intentions, it presents a serious conflict with the Fourth Amendment and expands the policing powers of federal probation officers.  While there is a need to protect law enforcement officers who are performing their duties, the Probation Officer Protection Act is an answer in search of a problem. Interference with a federal probation officer is already unlawful and current law already allows a law enforcement officer to arrest an individual or individuals who obstruct a federal probation officer during the performance of their duties.  The instances in which third parties obstruct a federal probation officer are rare. According to the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System, less than 4 percent of third parties were uncooperative during pre-approved searches in 2013, less than 6 percent in 2014, and 7 percent in 2016. Separately, the Federal Probation and Pretrial Officers Association reported that only 3 percent of searches in 2016 involved uncooperative third parties. While probationers have lost some of their Fourth Amendment rights, third parties have not. The Probation Officer Protection Act could lead to instances in which the Fourth Amendments rights of third parties are infringed because of overly broad language in Section 2(b) or interpretations of words in it, such as “intimidation” or “interference.”  Additionally, the “rules and regulations” under which the arrest authority of federal probation officers will be determined by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, not by Congress. This creates yet another situation in which Congress is relenting its constitutional authority to another branch of the federal government.  You can find the text of the bill here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1039/text"

1771,RepPerlmutter,Democrat,"I’m shocked to learn Attorney General Sessions did not disclose his communications with Russian officials during the presidential campaign. With AG Sessions now at the center of this investigation, it’s clear he cannot be trusted to conduct a full and fair investigation into the ties between Trump officials and Russia. Furthermore, as a lawyer and a member of the Bar Association, AG Sessions has an obligation to avoid any appearance of impropriety and this standard appears to have been breached. A special prosecutor needs to be appointed immediately in order to lead a neutral investigation and get to the bottom of this.   This certainly leads us to wonder what the President, the Attorney General and the Administration are hiding. Congressional Republicans have continued to obstruct the process to investigate ties between Russia and President Trump and his officials.    The American people deserve nothing less than an independent, thorough investigation because we cannot allow a foreign nation to have undue influence over our democracy."

1777,CongresswomanClark,Democrat,"It should concern every American that Trump not only endorses radical ideologues like Bannon, but is placing him on the National Security Council while demoting intelligence leaders. Presidents from both parties have warned of the danger of mixing political strategists with critical national security decisions. Bannon's appointment is not only unprecedented, but his embrace of xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic, and racist ideologies endangers our national security."

1786,RepTedBudd,Republican,"This is an exciting day. Today marks another important milestone in the process of reforming our tax code for the first time in over thirty years. Since the beginning, I have asked three main questions: will this bill cut taxes for the middle-class, does this bill make our business climate competitive in the global economy, and does this bill simplify the tax filing process for people at home? The answer to all of these questions are ‘yes.’  Specifically, as a result of this bill the average middle-class family in my district earning $59,000 will receive a $1,182 tax cut. Rather than giving it to the IRS, a family would be able to keep this money and use for more important things such as raising their children or paying down debt.   While there are still many steps left before any tax laws are changed, I’m optimistic and look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming weeks to pass much-needed tax relief for the American people before Christmas."
1787,RepRogerWilliams,Republican,"Protecting the unborn is critical to our core American values and it is our moral obligation to protect those who cannot protect themselves. I made a promise to the people of Texas’ 25th Congressional District that I would vote with my conscience and use God’s word as my guide. I have continually fought for pro-life rights, which is why I am proud to have cosponsored H.R. 36. I am a firm believer that life begins at the moment of conception, and this bill saves the unborn from an excruciatingly painful abortion if they are 20 weeks or more along. We still have a long way to go, but I am encouraged by the House passing this bill, and I urge the Senate to take this up as quickly as possible"

There are couples in 6 states and the District of Columbia that are unable to claim refunds for certain years that they were legally married.

This amendment, prohibiting the use of funds to implement or enforce the designation of any area of the Chesapeake Bay watershed as a “Critical Habitat” for the Atlantic Sturgeon, was adopted by the committee with bipartisan support. The Appropriations Committee’s adoption of this amendment is a victory for both the conservation of the Bay and the Eastern Shore’s Economy."
1791,RepCheri,Democrat,"I am deeply saddened by the death of Navy Seal Ryan Owens of Peoria. Chief Special Warfare Operator Owens died serving our nation in a raid against Al Qaeda in Yemen and our nation owes him and his family our deep and heartfelt gratitude.

My prayers are with Ryan’s family, friends and the entire Peoria community as we mourn this tragic loss."
1792,joecourtney,Democrat,"I continue to hear from many constituents impacted by crumbling foundations. A report was released yesterday by the Department of Consumer Protection detailing the efforts of Commissioner Jonathan Harris and his team to solve this horrific problem. One thing that is clear: this is going to require a concerted effort from all levels of government in order to develop tangible solutions for impacted homeowners.   Crumbling foundations have so far impacted 23 Connecticut communities. The damage to homes has the potential to harm the local housing market and could ripple across our state, hindering our efforts to achieve a full economic recovery. My office received confirmation last August that federal resources can be applied to this problem through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Local leaders are hard at work trying to leverage these resources, which combined with help from other stakeholders, insurers, lenders and home builders can stop the escalating harm this report identifies. I look forward to working with along with them and my colleagues in the federal delegation to further flush out such opportunities for relief."
1793,RepClaudiaTenney,Republican,"Today, I testified in front of the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity on bill I introduced earlier this year, H.R. 1690, the Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act. The bill was introduced with strong bipartisan support.  I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In fact, I know that many of them do. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care they receive from the VA Hospital in Syracuse as well as local VA clinics in Binghamton and Rome. However, given the patterns of mismanagement at the VA, it is imperative that Americans know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency. Moreover, Congress deserves to receive this information in timely manner without having to request it each year.   The bill I have introduced will provide transparency over the bonus process without placing an undue burden on the agency. Increasing oversight will help to ensure that our veterans, who have made the selfless sacrifice to serve our nation, receive the highest quality of care possible."

While I am glad stories like Banah’s have put pressure on the President to take Iraq off the travel ban list, his new executive order is no less harmful to our national security or the fabric of America.

1825,RepLaMalfa,Republican,"In recent years, lack of rain combined with poor planning for future water infrastructure has caused California to experience severe droughts that have devastated agriculture, habitat, and the economy in general.   That same lack of infrastructure has prevented us from storing enough water during a rainy season, like we’ve seen this year, to prevent flooding and save for the future. There are many potential water projects around the state that could have helped remedy this problem, but they have been trapped in bureaucratic limbo for many years - even decades.   The bill we passed today would require the federal government to expedite the process of approving and completing water projects.

1843,congressmanjohndelaney,Democrat,"For each day of #BlackHistoryMonth we're celebrating history-makers from Maryland. Today we remember Frances Harper, a Baltimore-born abolitionist, poet and author. Harper was born in 1825 to free parents, but was raised by her aunt and uncle. She was exposed to literature and prose throughout her schooling at the Academy for Negro Youth, inspiring her to write poetry from a young age. Harper’s poetry career formally began in 1845 with the release of her first collection, Forest Leaves. After teaching at Union Seminary, a school that was ran by abolitionist John Brown, Harper focused her writing talents towards the abolitionist movement.  In addition to joining the anti-slavery lecture circuit, Harper wrote renowned pieces including “Bury Me in a Free Land” and “Sketches of Southern Life.” These poems brought to life the themes and stories of the abolitionist movement.  “Bury Me in a Free Land” begins, “Make me a grave where’er you will,/ In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill;/ Make it among earth’s humblest graves,/ But not in a land where men are slaves.” Harper further made history as the first African-American woman to publish a short story. Along with Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells and other female abolitionists, Harper helped found a national association for African-American women. Harper passed away in 1911."

Just meet some Dreamers and you’ll see – they’re our kids, our classmates, our teammates. Tonight I introduced three of these kids on the Senate floor – one of them was an intern in my office.

1854,RepDanKildee,Democrat,"Every Michigander should be able to get quality and affordable health insurance to care for their families. That is what the Affordable Care Act set out to accomplish. The law is not perfect, and I’ll work with anyone – Democrats or Republicans – to make necessary changes to the law to provide better care.  What will not provide better or less expensive care, however, is repealing the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. That would do the opposite – raise health insurance costs, kick millions off their health care, and put insurers back in charge of patients’ health care."

In her confirmation hearings, Ms. DeVos failed to demonstrate that she is qualified to effectively advocate for public education and the best interests of all students and educators. Hundreds of Fourth District residents have called my office to voice similar concerns, and I join them in calling on the Senate to reject Ms. DeVos’s misguided nomination."

1861,RepEliotLEngel,Democrat,"It’s fitting that today would be Fred Korematsu’s 98th birthday. Korematsu was a Japanese-American civil rights activist who was jailed for fleeing the Japanese internment camps during World War II under Executive Order 9066. Mr. Korematsu sued the U.S. government, arguing that mass internment of ethnic minorities violated the U.S. Constitution. In 1944, he lost that argument in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. That the Supreme Court of the United States could sign off on mass detention of an ethnic minority should remind us all: this has happened here before, and it can happen here again.  The President’s Muslim ban – which the White House has said that they plan to expand in the future – undermines our values in the same ways as Japanese internment camps did in the 1940s. And just as it was in the 40’s, it is fear and ignorance that are the driving forces behind these compromises of our values, masked under the veil of ‘security’. These men, women, and children who seek refuge here only want the same things as we do: a chance at a better life, lived free. But the administration has denied them that chance, with an executive order so brazen that it is obvious they are playing the same prejudicial games the U.S. played with refugees and ethnic minorities 75 years ago.  From turning back the Jews on the St. Louis to Japanese internment and beyond, we have witnessed these moments of profound darkness in our country before. It takes only a handful of officials at the highest levels of government to turn these repulsive ideas into the official policy of the United States. I am relieved that the Courts have put a hold on deportations under this ban, and I am grateful for the thousands who have stood up across the country to protest the President’s actions. But Mr. Korematsu’s story reminds us all how important the Supreme Court is, and it reminds us how easily we can fall into these horrible patterns if we do not stay vigilant."

In recent years we saw the labor participation rate dip to drastic lows, and we’re still working to bring that number back up to where it should be.  A crucial step in that process is having effective programs and resources to develop our workforce.  From offering co-operative educational opportunities and apprenticeships, to tailoring education to demand-centered career fields, during Workforce Development Week these are exactly the kinds of discussions going on in Washington and across the country, and I’m excited to see what comes of the effort. #WorkforceDevelopmentWeek"

1899,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"The Trump Administration just released its tax plan as President Trump stumbles to the 100 day mark. The claim that his multi-trillion dollar tax cut will pay for itself is as incredible as the claim that Mexico will pay for his multi-billion dollar border wall. Dripping in red ink, this proposal validates Trump’s boast that he is “the king of debt.” For Trump and his cohorts, “fiscal responsibility” is just a political slogan used to undermine the vital education, health care, and social services that they oppose, not a genuine commitment to restraining the national debt.     Boasting of his previous influence in bending the Tax Code to his whim, Trump claims only he can fix it. But will he “fix” it for himself, or fix it for the middle class? Without an end to the Republican cover-up of Trump’s tax returns, we cannot determine whether this is mostly just more self-enrichment for the Trump family.   His international tax plan lowers taxes on investment abroad, incentivizing companies to export jobs and profits. And he rewards corporate tax dodgers, who have previously stripped earnings from American sales and buried their treasure in exotic foreign tax havens, by taxing them at a mere dime on the dollar.     Trump talks like a populist but governs like a plutocrat. Like the near trillion dollar tax cut in the failed health care bill that he endorsed, Trump’s tax plan fills the coffers of giant corporations and lines the pockets of the superrich.  #TrumpCarnage"

1906,joecourtney,Democrat,"Last week, my district office hosted a ceremony in Windham to honor Vietnam-era veterans for their service during Vietnam.  During the ceremony, veterans were presented with a Vietnam Veteran Lapel Pin, which was a part of a commemoration program that I helped establish through legislation in 2008, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War. Many who served during this challenging time in our nation’s history never received the thank you or recognition they deserved. This pin, and the larger commemoration around it, is what Congress and our country are saying ‘thank you’ to all those who served.   Special thanks to Kjell Tollefsen, of Killingworth, who provided the keynote for the ceremony.  He served 16 years in the US Army as a helicopter pilot, and flew 1,098 combat hours in Vietnam. It was an honor to have him on hand to reflect and talk to those who shared similar experiences while serving during the Vietnam Era.   Eastern Connecticut is proud to be home to the highest number of veterans in Connecticut. There are over 60,000 veterans residing in eastern Connecticut, nearly 22,000 served during the Vietnam-era. I am glad my office was able to join the national effort to honor our Vietnam veterans. We will be holding additional Vietnam pin events in the future, and anyone interested in participating can learn more by calling my Norwich office at 860-886-0139."

Undocumented students who were brought to the U.S. through no fault of their own are working, going to school, living their lives, and contributing billions to the American economy. Ending DACA in order to deport its nearly 800,000 recipients  is cruel and heartless. Instead of devastating families, President Trump and Republicans should be working toward comprehensive immigration reform to permanently fix our broken immigration system.  President Trump has turned his back on these young people. Now is the time for Congress to stand up, speak out and have the courage to do the right thing.

I’m also concerned with media reports indicating that Iranian militants are spurring the hostilities and that the Iraqi military is using US-provided military equipment in their campaign against the Kurdish region.

1934,RepWesterman,Republican,"I joined Senator John Boozman, Senator Tom Cotton, Representative Rick Crawford, Congressman French Hill, and Congressman Steve Womack to reintroduce the APPROVAL Act today. The Assuring Private Property Rights Over Vast Access to Lands (APPROVAL) Act would require that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) receive the approval of both the governor and the public service commission of an affected state before exercising the federal power of eminent domain to acquire property for Section 1222 transmission projects."

1937,mdiazbalart,Republican,"Last night, the Trump administration approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant for the State of Florida, allowing the use of federal funds to reimburse response costs to fight a rapidly spreading wildfire in Collier County. Congressman Francis Rooney and I issued the following statement:   ""We are grateful to President Trump for recognizing the need for federal funding to fight these fires. Our firefighters and first responders are bravely on the front lines, and federal assistance to support them is critical. We will continue to support Governor Scott, the County Commission, and other local officials in any way we are able to.   ""We are extremely proud of our firefighters and first responders, and are confident in their capabilities to control this blaze."""
1938,jefffortenberry,Republican,"We will probably be in Appropriations Committee until midnight working on budget issues.  Along the way fun things can happen--the picture is a chance encounter with the founder of Samuel Adams brewing company. We had a good conversation about his newest hefeweisen and I said, “Give me an alternative.”  (Side note: congressional offices cannot spend money on alcohol purchases)"

1943,SenatorCortezMasto,Democrat,I applaud The United States Department of Justice's decision to grant $1 million of much-needed relief for our law enforcement officials who've been working around-the-clock in the wake of the tragic shooting on 1 October. This will help with costs associated with their response efforts.   We are Vegas Strong and we thank you.
1944,chrisvanhollen,Democrat,"Today, all across America, we honor those whose lives were taken from us in the brutal terrorist attacks sixteen years ago, including the brave first responders who sacrificed their own lives to save others.Those who attacked us sought to divide us. Instead, Americans responded by uniting as one to rebuild and fight back.  As we memorialize those we lost, let us rededicate ourselves to reaching out as neighbors to help those in need. We are witnessing that unity in the response to the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Here, in every part of Maryland, thousands of volunteers are devoting their time and talent to help others in our community. Today, I was honored to join The 6th Branch, a veterans-led service group in Baltimore City, as they gathered hundreds of volunteers to participate in the Together We Serve 9/11 Day of Service, working to support schools and neighborhoods in East Baltimore. Sixteen years ago, our hearts were broken, but not our resolve. Let us recommit ourselves to working together for the American we love."
1945,reptrey,Republican,"Today, I stood for Hoosiers. I stood to ensure that they receive more of their hard-earned paychecks; I stood to ensure that a convoluted and archaic tax code was simplified; I stood to ensure that special interests deductions and loopholes were removed; I stood to ensure that Hoosier small business can get back to creating jobs, innovating new products, and reinvesting in our local economies."

1947,SenatorShaheen,Democrat,"I just spoke on the Senate floor against Betsy DeVos's nomination and read letters from parents and educators in New Hampshire. Public schools provide the best opportunity for kids from all walks of life to get a quality education. Given her past record, it makes no sense to put Ms. DeVos in charge of the Department of Education unless the aim is to devalue, defund, and perhaps eventually destroy our public schools. I've received more than 4,000 letters and emails, and 1405 calls, nearly all opposing her nomination. Thank you for making your voices heard! --JS"
1948,JohnKennedyLouisiana,Republican,"Middle class families are the engine of the American economy, and it's high time they're treated like it. I'm proposing doubling the standard deduction, which would put over $600 billion back into your pockets. I'm standing up for the middle class families and small businesses who desperately need some tax relief. Let me know if you agree."
1949,RepRonEstes,Republican,"Hello, Facebook! Like my page for updates!"
1950,congressmanpittenger,Republican,"The heinous attack on Coptic Christians, killing at least 28 innocent people on a bus, again reveals the dreadful reality of the ominous threat of Islamic terrorists on all who do not subscribe to this diabolical cult.  We must be vigilant and unified to eliminate this enemy.  Earlier this year, I met with Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II and Rev. Dr. Andrea Zaki Stephanous, President of the Protestant Churches of Egypt, and my heart goes out to their besieged community."
1951,RepAndyBarr,Republican,"Carol and I offer our thoughts and prayers to my good friend House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, his wife Jennifer and their children, as well as to my other colleagues, the staff members and law enforcement officers affected by this morning’s shooting and to their families.

1952,RepMcEachin,Democrat,"I am so pleased to announce that Hickory High School was named a Blue Ribbon school. Their academics and their work for students to succeed are outstanding.

1955,RepGutierrez,Democrat,A press release sent out by my office today urging FEMA to quickly approve Gov. Rossello's request for Temporary Shelter Assistance.  It is an important first step.

1959,RepMcEachin,Democrat,"The Student Loan Refinancing Act #HR1614 would enable borrowers with federal student loans to refinance their loans whenever a lower interest rate becomes available.  Providing students with the opportunity to get a higher education so they can get good-paying jobs and be productive, constructive citizens is one of my most important goals. However, with the escalating costs of higher education, these students are graduating with crushing debt, hampering their ability to contribute to the economy and invest in their community by purchasing homes. This legislation is a step in the right direction to help these students. It will remove current restrictions on financing and allow students to refinance whenever borrowing rates go down. We need to do whatever we can to reduce the costs of higher education and to help students overcome seemingly insurmountable debt. I am pleased to make this small start and will continue to work to improve the future for our youth by increasing educational and vocational opportunities at manageable costs.  The Student Loan Refinancing Act will allow more than 44 million Americans to refinance their federal student loans and the bill has garnered bipartisan support."
1960,CongressmanClayHiggins,Republican,"Proud to stand with Chairman McCaul and members of the Homeland Security Committee in sponsoring the DHS Authorization Act of 2017. National Security is an issue that effects every man, woman, and child, Republicans and Democrats in our nation.

Chao. “TIGER grants will continue to fund innovative projects that will improve the safety of America’s passengers and goods.”"
1964,DuncanHunter,Republican,"I’ve worked a lot of military cases over the years – but few have received the same attention as Marine Corps Sgt Rafael Peralta, who smothered a grenade in Fallujah, Iraq.  He was nominated for the Medal of Honor but the award was downgraded because of politics.  I then led the effort to get a ship in his name.  And now that ship has been turned over to the Navy and will carry his name everywhere in the world, and inspire sailors and Marines, and serve as a testament to his courage and sacrifice."
1965,congressmanpittenger,Republican,"The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, located in Robeson and surrounding counties, has sought federal recognition since 1888.  They deserve the same recognition and benefits as other federally recognized tribes.  This is about fairness and providing equal opportunities to encourage economic growth.  Today, I had the honor of hosting Harvey Godwin, Jr. Lumbee Tribal Chairman  for a meeting with House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop (UT-01).  We discussed scheduling a committee hearing on my Lumbee Recognition Act later this fall, and other steps to ensure fair treatment for the Lumbees."

1969,senshelley,Republican,"Tax reform is essential in helping West Virginia families, small businesses and communities recover from the effects of a stagnant economy and grow again.

1970,SenatorMarcoRubio,Republican,"#Egypt’s repression isn’t limited to its own citizens. There are currently a number of Americans in jail in Egypt, including Aya Hijazi.   Aya was arrested in May 2014 along with her husband and other members of her organization, the Belady Foundation, which works with abandoned and homeless youth, rescuing young children off the streets. Aya was charged with ridiculous allegations, including paying the children to participate in demonstrations against the government. To date, no evidence has been provided to back these allegations.   Almost three years later, this American citizen remains in prison. Egypt should release her, her husband and the other workers immediately. #ExpressionNotOppression"

Colleen Hanabusa:  What is most troubling about these emails is their contradiction of unequivocal denials by the administration.  Congress has important work to do on behalf of the people.  We need to move beyond the daily distraction of Russian collusion and interference in our U.S. election by allowing a bipartisan independent commission to fully investigate these serious issues while Congress focuses on healthcare, jobs, infrastructure, the military and our national budget."

1976,GwenSMoore,Democrat,"""Donald J. Trump wants to remove us from undue federal scrutiny by removing ‘white supremacists’ from the definition of ‘extremism,’” the founder and editor of a prominent neo-Nazi website wrote in a post on the site. “Yes, this is real life. Our memes are all real life. Donald Trump is setting us free.”"
1977,RepJimBanks,Republican,"Indiana is well-positioned to play a larger role in our country’s national defense. Our state’s robust system of military installations, universities, industry partners and the nation’s fourth-largest National Guard collaborate on sophisticated projects and form what I call our “Hoosier Arsenal of Democracy.” I have seen firsthand how Hoosiers are working together to tackle the most acute security challenges facing our nation."

1981,CongressmanMarcVeasey,Democrat,"I represent the single highest uninsured Congressional district in the entire country. With rumors that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may try to force a full repeal vote on the Affordable Care Act as early as tomorrow, I have to highlight again the damage repealing the ACA will cause for thousands of families in my district who already struggle to pay for a routine check-up. Texas Republicans did nothing to alleviate this problem when they discouraged Governor Abbott to refuse Medicaid expansion that would have extended care to thousands of Texans. The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but it's time that both sides of the aisle come together and work on a bipartisan fix that works for all Americans."

1996,CongressmanSethMoulton,Democrat,"Creating jobs and a 21st century transportation system was a promise that President Trump made to this country.

1998,repjimrenacci,Republican,"Tax filings cost American taxpayers billions of dollars every year. On top of this, Obamacare created even more taxes which are especially burdensome in that they require a tremendous amount of manpower from the IRS. Not only do we need to repeal and replace Obamacare, but we need to simplify our tax code so businesses can focus on their customers and growth, while families focus on supporting their love ones. These priorities matter. We should not be shelling out hard earned income to comply with this obsolete tax code. #TaxReformTuesday"

2000,USCongressmanFilemonVela,Democrat,"Last night Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 4, also known as the “Show Me Your Papers” bill, into law. The racist bill is an attack on human decency that preys on some of our most vulnerable by driving a wedge between law enforcement, universities, immigrant communities, and people of color. Local police and campus police aim to protect and build trust with local residents, but the ""Show Me Your Papers"" bill shifts the focus away from keeping communities safe. Instead of turning to local law enforcement in times of peril, mixed status families and noncitizens may now withhold important information when reporting crimes, or stop reporting crimes at all, out of fear of deportation. Under the guise of creating a law to uphold the Constitution and treating all people equally, the Texas legislature has schemed to continue the demonization of immigrant communities. SB4 is a disgrace, and I strongly oppose it."

2016,repjoecrowley,Democrat,"President Trump’s threats are a slap in the face to the people of Puerto Rico. We cannot abandon our brothers and sisters who are simply asking for the same aid and assistance to rebuild their homes, economy, and lives that any U.S. citizen would expect from their government following an unprecedented natural disaster and humanitarian crisis.  When 90 percent of the island still lacks electricity and the majority of people lack access to clean drinking water, the Trump administration must intensify its support of Puerto Rico – not issue baseless threats to abandon these Americans.   Our commitment to helping Puerto Rico rebuild must be measured in months and years – not days and weeks. President Trump’s threats to abandon Puerto Rico show a deep disregard for the pain and suffering of our fellow Americans. This is simply wrong."

2022,jaredpolis,Democrat,"There’s been a lot of talk in the news lately about crypto-currency, bitcoin, and blockchain, so I wanted to give a quick explanation. Cryptocurrency is essentially digital cash, such as Bitcoin, that is created and stored through a distributed online network. Transactions are verified online through a network of computers, and then combined with other transactions to create a new block of data. That block of data is then stored across a universal ledger known as blockchain, which is a permanent record book for transactions that is updated instantly and can never be altered.   As the founder and Co-Chair of the Blockchain Caucus, I am working to modernize the law to allow cryptocurrencies to be more available to consumers by reducing IRS reporting requirements for small transactions. Deploying blockchain technology has important benefits across many areas of the economy and will hopefully lead to benefits for consumers, increased privacy, more efficiency, and new jobs."
2023,RepMarkDeSaulnier,Democrat,"President Trump’s decision to disclose highly classified information without considerable thought, consultation with the intelligence community, or recognition of the consequences is deeply disturbing. The President divulged more information to the Russians than the United States has thus far shared with its allies. This action hurts the credibility of the United States, endangers sources, methods, and assets in the field—many of whom are risking their lives to keep America safe—and jeopardizes our national security.

Elevated PCB levels can lead to contamination among the lake’s fish populations.  I'm very happy to see this result!"

These men, women and children may be thousands of miles away from Delaware, but they are our neighbors and we have a responsibility to help them recover and rebuild. The president has taken an important first step that temporarily makes it easier to ship aid and supplies to Puerto Rico, and we’re glad Congress has approved a first installment of disaster assistance, but there’s much more work to be done.   “The Delaware National Guard has deployed troops and flown two dozen relief missions, but we are ready and willing to do more. We have more guard units specialized in communications, engineering, aviation, security, medical, and heavy truck driving that are ready and eager to assist the emergency response efforts.   ""We are committed to doing everything in our power to help, but the Trump Administration has the critical responsibility of taking the lead and activating the full force of the federal government to help these people. It must start by issuing a full disaster declaration for the entire island of Puerto Rico to ensure they can make use of all the assistance our country can give.”"

2090,senatoralfranken,Democrat,"Here is one of the chief problems we face when trying to address harassment in the workplace: we have people steadfastly unwilling to admit that the system we have now isn’t working and overwhelmingly favors employers over employees. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today, a representative from the National Federation of Independent Businesses, FOUR TIMES refused to answer my question about whether mandatory arbitration clauses—which prevent employees from taking their claims to court and often require employees keep their claims secret—are problematic because they prevent victims from speaking out.  I just wanted a simple yes or no: do you think that these clauses ostensibly designed to silence victims are problematic? After trying to dodge the question for several minutes, she finally answered: no.   Well, I strongly disagree.   I believe that giving people access to courts ensures that they can seek justice when they’ve been wronged. And it allows other people who’ve experienced the same thing to see that they’re not alone.   Forced arbitration deprives Americans one of their most fundamental constitutional rights: the right to seek justice in a court of law. And all too often it ensures that victims remain silent. It’s just another way that corporations can put their thumb on the scale. It’s wrong, and I’m going to continue my fight to end this practice."

2120,RepRonEstes,Republican,"Congressman Ron Estes (KS-4) released the following statement today on the decision by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City to pull out of Obamacare.  “Obamacare is clearly broken and Congress must fix it. The law is collapsing before our eyes. In Kansas and across the country, millions of Americans are hurting and rightfully concerned about what will happen next.”    “This decision highlights the urgent need to replace Obamacare.  I was proud to support the American Health Care Act which passed the House earlier this month.  The law will help the very people affected by this decision by making care more affordable and accessible. The best way to provide great care to all Americans is to build a patient-centered system focused on the individual. As today’s news show, putting government at the center of healthcare just doesn’t work.”"

He understands that we can protect our environment with common sense policies that don’t attack job creators and send thousands of workers, like West Virginia’s coal miners, to the unemployment line.  In Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt tirelessly fought unwarranted regulations and federal government abuse. I am confident he will bring a pragmatic and balanced approach to the EPA by returning it to its original and lawful mission."
2158,RepJoyceBeatty,Democrat,"From President Trump's irrational firing of former FBI Director Comey, to divulging classified information to the very Russian officials involved in an ongoing FBI investigation—not to mention the many conflicting reports and misinformation coming out of the White House over the past week—Americans are demanding answers and want the truth. That is why I am signing a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill that would create an independent commission to investigate and to urge Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans to quit playing politics with our national security. It is long past time that we finally get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in our election, as well as any possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

The U.S. must act strongly to prevent the overturning of a post-Cold War security order in Eurasia that has allowed for unprecedented peace and prosperity. We must guard against Russian objectives that seek to weaken NATO, OSCE, and our nation.  It's critical to our national interest that the United States stand with our allies against Russia’s sustained and dangerously destabilizing strategy of economic sanctions, political pressure, propaganda, and cyberattacks.  By ignoring Russia’s actions we not only risk Eastern Europe's future, where heavy-handed Russian interference undermine hopes for an open and democratic society, but also our own national security interests."

2168,joecourtney,Democrat,"Today’s announcement by Mitch McConnell canceling his rushed vote on the GOP health plan is good news for America’s patients and families. This sudden turnabout did not happen in a vacuum. It was because of the unprecedented outpouring of opposition from groups as diverse and respected as the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, American Cancer Society, March of Dimes, Catholic Health Association, AARP, Alliance for Retired Americans, Children's Hospital Association, and countless other advocacy groups warning that this bill, written in secret without any care, would harm millions of Americans.  It would damage the infrastructure of our nation’s delivery of services, and hurt nursing homes, rural hospitals, community clinics and elder care. Hopefully after the July 4th recess the Republican majority will heed this call for a responsible public process that will produce bipartisan solutions to fixing our healthcare system."
2169,repdonbeyer,Democrat,"All of Donald J. Trump's rhetoric is about taking us backwards. There's a better way. Fund scientific research and development, and create incentives for clean energy jobs.

Ford’s roots run deep in Michigan’s 12th District, and these investments bolster the company’s dedication to building its highest-tech vehicles here in the U.S. and strengthen its commitment to American workers, who are the best in the world.   Ford’s announcement of a new advanced data center at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant also further positions the company as a leader in the future of mobility, including the development of connected and automated vehicles which have the potential to improve safety and save lives. This is a day to celebrate U.S. manufacturing as it continues to grow and evolve and support American jobs, and pledge to continue working together to keep Michigan and the U.S. at the forefront of innovation and technology."
2173,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"This week's Tax Policy Subcommittee hearing is the first to explore the impact on individual taxpayers of the GOP's tax blueprint introduced over 13 months ago. I offer comments on lessons learned from the first GOP tax bill this year and express concern about current tax provisions intended to encourage retirement savings. Recent studies show how unevenly these laws work: 60% percent of American households get a mere 16% of the tax benefits, while the top 20% of income earners get 66% of retirement tax incentive benefits. We need to improve a system in which too many families are not adequately prepared for retirement. You can watch here including good advice from Eric Rodriguez of UnidosUS."

Now more than ever, we must work with world leaders to reduce nuclear stockpiles and pave the way to a nuclear-free world. We have the opportunity to leave our children a more secure future.

More specifics can be found here: http://bit.ly/2wAMZF2   • First, any future decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan will depend on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables. The President wants America’s enemies to know they can never wait us out or doubt our resolve.  • Second, the new strategy will integrate all instruments of American power—diplomatic, economic, and military—in a way that is sustainable and cost-effective. We will bolster the fighting strength of government forces by providing advisors to Afghan brigades and additional combat air support in order to convince the Taliban they cannot win on the battlefield. This will set conditions for the ultimate goal of our strategy: a peace settlement between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban that protects our interests.  • Third, our approach with Pakistan will change: it will reflect the commonsense understanding that no partnership can survive a country’s tolerance for militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. Any country that takes this course will be held accountable.  • New strategy will also emphasize developing our strategic partnership with India—the world’s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner. We will work with India to further our common interest and defending our common values."

2193,RepSanfordSC,Republican,"Our youngest son graduates from high school today.    It’s hard to believe that Blake joined our family over eighteen years ago, and now we’re to the point of him leaving the nest this fall. It’s bittersweet. On the one hand, at the head level, I know this is what’s supposed to happen, and I’m excited about his movement in life. At a heart level, I’m conflicted, given he won’t be there most weekends as a best buddy to head down to the farm. Those of you who have graduates - or children who have moved away - know exactly what I’m talking about.    The long and short of all this is that I want to take this occasion not only to wish our son a happy graduation...but to wish all those high school graduates across the Lowcountry the same.    I would pass on but two encouragements.    One, recognize that graduations are milestones. They’re a chance to stop and to smell the flowers, rejoicing in the day...while at the same time reflecting on its meaning and what it means in life’s next step. The military does a very good job with promotions and retirements in the way that they stop and reflect on what a team member has meant to that team. For each of you as graduates, do make it a point in life’s many passages to stop, pause, and reflect. It was Socrates who said that the unexamined life was not worth living, and these pauses create inflection points to indeed reflect on whether or not what you’re doing now is really what you want to be doing, and where you think your talents might best be used in this precious journey called life.   Two, habits matter. If one brushes their teeth on a daily basis and makes it a habit, you can expect to get fewer cavities. A graduation suggests that a number of worthwhile habits have been instilled, and my simple point here is that I would continue to add to your list of life affirming habits. They will pay great dividends, and this graduation shows an early sign of their taking hold.    Back to the issue at hand for me and our family, though!   ...which is that I wish Blake the absolute best as he goes off to Georgetown University this fall. You’ve made your entire family most proud of the young man that you’ve become and the habits that you’ve instilled. We look forward to watching your future successes, and wish you godspeed in the journey.    I wish you the best in wishing “your graduate” the same!"

2196,CongressmanLouBarletta,Republican,"I applaud President Trump for outlining a South Asia strategy based in reality rather than ideology.  Unlike previous approaches, President Trump made clear that his administration’s strategy will be dictated by our nation’s top military experts and the conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables set by politicians in Washington.  As President Trump stated, and as history has proven true, ‘Micromanagement in Washington does not win battles.’   For far too long, we have put our troops at a disadvantage with overly restrictive rules of engagement and by telegraphing our military plans to the world.  The former administration made bad deal after bad deal, sending billions of dollars to countries that provided safe havens for terrorists while doing nothing to hold them accountable.  That will not continue under this administration.   We are finally going to rely on the guidance of our military leadership and redefine victory in realistic terms.  Our goals are clear: facilitate stability and security in the region so that terrorists cannot threaten the United States.  We are killing terrorists, not building nations.  Afghanistan’s future will be determined by the Afghan people.   While President Trump is committed to carrying out this mission in partnership with countries in the region, particularly Pakistan and India, he is demanding that they step up and contribute their fair share.  This is a strategy that puts America’s interests first and will advance the fight against terrorist organizations that threaten our interests both at home and abroad."

President-elect Donald Trump has promised to “immediately terminate” President Obama’s executive actions on immigration, including deportation protections granted to DREAMers. All of us have a stake in our DREAMers because we have invested in them. DREAMers have played by the rules and now want to join the workforce and give back to their community.   What will that mean for our country and DREAMers who call this community home?  Join me, Hillsborough County School Board Member Susan L. Valdes,Dr. Lydia Medrano of LULAC, and other experts and family defenders for a special town hall meeting on immigration focused on the DREAMers."

2207,RepBost,Republican,"The top priority of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. It’s clear that we need a top-down review of our vetting process. In the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and elsewhere, I  voted for bipartisan legislation to pause the intake of refugees from certain high risk locations until our screening systems are improved. Given the world we live in today, taking steps to strengthen our national security is simple common sense.

2208,RepClaudiaTenney,Republican,"STORY/ HEADLINE CORRECTION  Please know that today’s headline from the Utica OD is INCORRECT and should say Medicaid, not Medicare.  I support Medicare and will continue to work to strengthen and protect this important program that our seniors rely on.  As for Medicaid, this program is a lifeline for many and it should be strengthened so that it can better serve those it was actually designed to help: the disabled, children, and the truly needy. However, there is much waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid that must be dealt with to streamline the program.  The Utica OD has updated online and will run a correction in tomorrow’s print edition. If you have any questions, please contact one of my offices.  We apologize for the error and hope that you will share this correction to set the record straight.

2225,reppaultonko,Democrat,"Tax reform should streamline the connection between our economy and our systems for funding effective public services, services that reflect our deeply-held American values, many of which also have a strong economic multiplier.   A real tax reform plan would drive 80% of the benefits to 80% of taxpayers, America's middle class, while unleashing the potential for startups and small businesses to create jobs and hire, innovate and get their products and services to the marketplace.  From the overviews and summaries that have been revealed about the secretive GOP tax plan, 80% of the benefits will go to the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

As I have said before, Bashar al-Assad is a war criminal who has starved, barrel bombed, and besieged the Syrian people for more than six years.

2234,herrerabeutler,Republican,"Here in Washington state, Association Health Plans (AHPs) currently provide roughly 400,000 individuals with quality, affordable health care plans – and that’s despite these popular programs being undermined and restricted by our state’s Insurance Commissioner. For many years, I’ve worked in a bipartisan manner to strengthen AHPs because they are a critical solution to making good health care more attainable for more people. If implemented correctly, the President’s expansion of AHPs could help bring down costs of quality care for thousands of Washingtonians.   Unfortunately, supporting small businesses who want to provide health coverage for employees is one of the greatest areas of failure under the Affordable Care Act; the Obamacare small business exchange operated by Washington state only insures 164 people across all of Washington. There is no reason why small businesses shouldn’t be able to band together and offer employees the same types of quality health care plans as labor unions and large corporations do, and I will be eagerly monitoring how this executive order is implemented and will help however I can to make sure it is successful here in Southwest Washington."

2237,RepJohnLarson,Democrat,"Once again, Congress is complicit for its lack of action and its refusal to bring a vote to the House floor. 26 lives were lost yesterday in Texas, including young children, and others remain hospitalized. Tragically, three generations of one family were murdered. I am deeply saddened by the news and my sincere condolences go out to the families and friends of the victims. As members of Congress, we join these families and the community in mourning, but we were elected to do a job and to do something about the senseless gun violence. These tragedies that happen too often in our streets, schools, public buildings, and our churches will continue to occur until Congress has the courage to take up legislation to prevent gun violence. Thoughts and prayers are no longer enough. We need action, NOW."

The people of Guam deserve transparency so it is unfortunate that we are learning of this Administration’s proposed decision through the media. Earlier this month, 26 of my Democratic colleagues and I asked the President to make this “secret” memo public to give clarity and certainty to the American people about the future of their national monuments.

The $56 billion bill funds the Departments of Commerce and Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and other related agencies.   This bill funds the first comprehensive and holistic attack on deadly opioid overdoses. It has robust funding for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), maintains funding for drug courts and residential substance treatment programs, increases funding for the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, methamphetamine lab cleanups and youth mentoring programs. This is a wholesale attack on this national epidemic identified by the CDC.   The committee also rejected the Trump Administration's proposal to rescind funding previously secured in fiscal year 2016 for construction of a federal prison in Letcher County.   I'm pleased that funding remains intact for construction of the federal prison in Letcher County, and the project will continue as scheduled.  In addition to comprehensive funding to combat the drug abuse epidemic, I advocated for $30 million to continue economic development assistance for coal mining communities; $95 million for the Bureau of Prisons for construction, acquisition and maintenance of prison facilities; $300 million for Legal Services Corporation, a funding source that has recently assisted victims of the Eric C. Conn fiasco in Eastern Kentucky; and space science research, which will help continue competitive programs at the University of Kentucky and Morehead State University.   Click the link below for more details about the bill."

2301,reprichardneal,Democrat,"Today I was named by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to be a conferee to deliberate the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018. This is an important assignment as the NDAA includes many provisions that the First Congressional District of Massachusetts relies on. In the heart of this district is Westover Air Reserve Base and Barnes Air National Guard Base. The funding in this package would allow both sites to continue their efforts on the national level and provide jobs right here in western Massachusetts. Warren Pumps in the east and General Dynamics in the west would both be able to continue their contracts with the Department of Defense. These bases and companies are imperative to the economy here in western Massachusetts. Not only are these places that provide employment to a large number of constituents, the work that is done in each facility provides assistance to the United States’ objectives around the world. Therefore, I am thrilled to be chosen for this position to ensure the interests of these vital agencies are held in high regard."

2303,RepJeffDuncan,Republican,"People are clamoring about why the House doesn't just bring up and pass one bill which does away with Obamacare and possibly includes some free-market reforms. (BTW - the 2015 Reconciliation Bill sent to President Obama's desk didn't repeal Obamacare - that is a misconception).  We can.  And - there are bills out there to do just that!  I am a cosponsor of the Rand Paul bill carried in the House by Mark Sanford.  Here is the problem:  general legislative bills must get 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster.  Republicans have 54 votes. That is why House is trying to do as much as possible within the contraints of the budget reconciliation bill, a bill that is only available once a year (to reconcile the annual budget) and which must only deal with budgetary matters.  And ""de-funding"" things like Planned Parenthood"" in an annual bill like this would only last for one-year, I believe.  (I do know this bill only applied to PP for one year.)  So, Planned Parenthood would only lose funding for one year (but think about how many babies we could save in one year!).  It is near impossible to include policy changes in the reconciliation bill or it fails the rules-test and ultimately kills the bill - as well as the only chance in this fiscal year to begin dismantling Obamacare.  Remember: Pelosi's democrats ended up having to use reconciliation as the vehicle to pass Obamacare because, when Scott Brown was elected, they no longer had 60 votes in the Senate.  House Conservatives were pushing leadership to put as much as possible in the reconciliation bill; House moderates were pushing to limit what was there - thus creating a fine line for the required number of votes.  Speaker Ryan made the right call to cancel the vote - because if it failed, that reconciliation vehicle would die for the year, this ending any chance to craft a better bill and get another crack at moving it to the Senate.  Hope that helps."

2312,joecourtney,Democrat,"This is a crucial week in the fight to save net neutrality. On Thursday the FCC will vote on whether or not to repeal Title II net neutrality rules regulations that were created in 2015 to ensure that the internet remains free and open for all users. The FCC chairman’s push to gut these protections creates room for major broadband services to institute pay-for-play systems in order to maximize profit. An internet that favors the deep pockets of big corporations would have a direct, negative impact on small business in CT, and drive up costs for consumers.   Already, more than 220,000 CT residents have contacted the FCC to voice their strong opposition to this outrageous decision. The message is clear: these rules protect innovation, growth, and fair access. I fiercely oppose any effort to scrap net neutrality and will continue the fight to protect the net."

2350,repsheaporter,Democrat,"The latest changes to the Senate health care repeal bill would make a heartless plan even more extreme. The Cruz amendment would allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and to push bare-bones plans, bringing us back to the days when Americans experiencing a health crisis too often found out that care wasn’t covered in the moment that they needed it most.   New Hampshire families don’t want to face impossible decisions between lifesaving procedures and crippling debt. They don’t want insurance that covers less, and higher deductibles that force them to pay more out-of-pocket.   And Granite Staters won’t be fooled by this bill’s bait-and-switch approach to the opioid crisis, which woefully fails to justify taking coverage from millions who are struggling with substance use disorder. In fact, the Senate bill would send our communities backward in their fight against the heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioid crisis, kicking millions off Medicaid and private insurance while allowing insurance companies to weaken or eliminate coverage of behavioral health and substance use treatment."

Duplicative medical examinations regarding veterans’ disability claims add unnecessary delays and cost to the claims process.  Veterans seeking disability benefits deserve to have their claims decided quickly and efficiently.  That is why this legislation seeks to reduce the number of unnecessary disability examinations by requiring additional information be provided to Congress regarding the VA’s use of private medical evidence in support of claims for disability compensation.  By ultimately reducing the number of disability exams conducted in-house, VA physicians would have more time to dedicate to resources to providing care for our nation’s veterans."

The GOP replacement plan will give huge tax cuts to the very wealthy, paid for with higher priced insurance for older Americans and working Americans.  Republicans must ask themselves how far they are willing to go to tow the party line.

2405,RepColleenHanabusa,Democrat,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 24, 2017   Rep. Hanabusa to President Trump: Don’t Sabotage Healthcare  Washington, D.C. –Today, Rep. Hanabusa joined 195 House Democrats in a letter to President Trump reminding him that millions of working families around the nation are relying on him to continue paying the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments.  Since taking office, President Trump has raised doubts about the future of these payments, which help seven million hardworking Americans and their families afford their out-of-pocket health care costs, such as deductibles and copays, through the ACA Marketplace.    “It is your responsibility to the American people and your obligation under the law to make the cost-sharing reduction payments and to stop other acts of sabotage that undermine Americans’ access to affordable, quality health insurance,” Rep. Hanabusa and the House Democrats wrote.    The President’s failure to commit to paying these subsidies is destabilizing the Marketplaces, and will directly result in higher health care costs and insurance companies pulling out of the Marketplace, leading to fewer consumer choices.  If the Marketplace is destabilized, those constituents in Rep. Hanabusa's district who purchased high quality Marketplace coverage would face higher health care costs and fewer choices.    “The decision to unilaterally rescind support for these subsidies will cause premiums and out-of-pocket costs to skyrocket and could cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance coverage,” the House Democrats wrote.  “Insurers have little time left to finalize their rate filings for 2018, and without certainty as to whether or not cost-sharing subsidies will be paid, they will significantly raise their rates or exit the Marketplaces altogether.”     In April, a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that insurance premiums for certain plans would need to increase by 19 percent to compensate for the lack of funding for cost-sharing subsidies.   “Working families in every state are relying on you to pay cost-sharing subsidies to help ensure that they can afford the health care they need,” the House Democrats wrote. “The stability of the nation’s health care system and the health of millions of Americans now rest in your hands. Their health care coverage is not a bargaining chip.”"

As promised, the American Health Care Act will rescue our collapsing health care system, provide tax relief for middle-income families and business owners, and give Americans the opportunity to save more of their hard earned money. I care about ensuring a stable transition as we fulfill our promise to the American people and deliver long awaited access to truly affordable and sustainable health care.”  Importantly, this report has not factored into plans by Congress and the President to reinvigorate free market competition which will drive costs down even further and open up additional opportunities for flexibility, benefits, choice, and savings."

2443,MaxineWaters,Democrat,"Congresswoman Waters Introduces Legislation Urging Investigation of President Trump’s ties to Russia and Cyberattacks  Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced legislation demanding congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election including a thorough review of any collusion between persons associated, formally or informally, with President Donald Trump and the Russian government. In a press conference announcing the legislation with other progressive Members of Congress, Congresswoman Waters delivered the following remarks:  Like so many of you, we have been shaken by events that have occurred over the last 11 days since Donald Trump was inaugurated.  We have been shaken by the lies, the deception, and the stunning level of incompetence.   In just under two weeks, Donald Trump has unnerved our allies, challenged our values, and brought so much instability and chaos to our country.  This chaos is sure to please at least one person – Vladimir Putin.  For everyone Trump is quick to bully, from world leaders to gold star families, to disabled Americans, there seems to be one person on the world’s stage who can do no wrong in Trump’s eyes.  A dictator and former KGB agent who armed Assad in Syria as he attacked innocent civilians appears to be the only man that Donald Trump will not disparage.  Given the extensive ties between Russia and individuals associated with Trump, we cannot ignore the possibility that there may have been collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.    Both during his campaign and since his election, Donald Trump has surrounded himself with people who have extensive ties to Vladimir Putin and the Russian government.     • Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, was a paid lobbyist for Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian politician in Ukraine who fled to Russia in 2014 and was subjected to U.S. sanctions related to Russian aggression in Ukraine.  Manafort has also been involved in multimillion dollar business deals with Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, which were reportedly the subject of an FBI inquiry.  • Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime friend, is reportedly under investigation for possible links with Russia. He has denied ever visiting Russia but admitted he had worked in Ukraine.  Stone announced in a speech last summer that he had spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and Stone predicted that there would be additional leaked documents, a prediction that came true within weeks.  • Michael Flynn, Trump’s National Security Advisor, did a paid series of events in Moscow, including a speech and appearance at a party for RT, a Kremlin-funded TV station, where he was photographed sitting right next to Vladimir Putin.  • Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, was a business partner of Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch and Putin ally, in a major financial project involving the Bank of Cyprus.  • Finally, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State, signed a multibillion dollar agreement with Russia in 2011 on behalf of ExxonMobil for an oil drilling project in the Arctic. The project was brought to a halt in 2014 as a result of the sanctions that were imposed on Russia in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Putin personally awarded Tillerson the “Order of Friendship” in 2013.  The financial dealings and alliances in this Trump-Putin circle present obvious conflicts of interest for the Trump Administration, and they are too significant to be ignored.    Why did Paul Manafort and the Trump campaign push for softer language on the Ukraine in the Republican platform last summer?  What did Paul Manafort and Roger Stone know about the cyberattacks on their political opponents?  Why would Donald Trump deny knowledge of Russian responsibility for hacking even as he encouraged cyberattacks on his political opponent? We must find out just how involved the Trump campaign was in Russia’s interference in our election.  That is why I am introducing a resolution to focus on what Congress must do to thoroughly investigate Trump’s connections with Russia and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the outcome of the election.  We cannot allow any investigation led by the Republicans in Congress to whitewash Trump’s ties to Russia or avoid examining these critical questions.         ###"

2469,reppaultonko,Democrat,"There are many, many betrayals in the Ryan-McConnell #GOPTaxScam. One that will hurt America's historic cities is the elimination of a vital economic redevelopment tool called the Historic Preservation Tax Credit.  This credit has helped drive $390+ million in jobs & economic redevelopment in Albany, NY & even more across our region:  Albany: $391,318,726 Troy: $50,345,137 Saratoga Springs: $101,096,358 Cohoes: $139,825,786 Schenectady: $15,997,119 Other NY-20: Rexford ($140,000), Waterford ($269,921), Watervliet ($3,619,000)   NY-20 TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT: $702,612,047  Bottom line: whether you care about healthcare or teachers or students or veterans or small businesses or local economic development, our #UpstateNY economies lose big under the #GOPTaxScam."

2480,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"As explained in my prior post, as the Ranking Democrat on the Tax Policy Subcommittee, today I accepted an invitation to meet along with a few other House Ways & Means members at the White House. Trump asked for Democrats to jump on the caboose after the tax train has already left the station. I saw no Democrat ready to jump aboard.  Only hours before formally announcing the Republican tax break plan, we were given a preview of generalities that do not match what specifics are already known about this plan that is allegedly so “great” and which will make everyone so “happy.” Despite repeated claims of “no tax cuts for the rich,” this plan does the opposite by cutting the top tax rate and eliminating the estate tax.  It creates incentives to ship even more American jobs abroad.  Claiming that tax breaks will magically pay for themselves is like claiming Mexico will pay for his wall.  In fact, this huge set of tax breaks will be financed by borrowing more from the Saudis and the Chinese, threatening Social Security and Medicare."

2500,RepDWS,Democrat,"For millions of Americans, today is the deadline to file taxes. For Donald Trump, it's just another day of hiding his taxes returns. Apparently, it doesn't matter to him that every President since Richard Nixon has followed this basic standard. He's trying to ignore the tens of thousands of Americans who marched over the weekend to demand the release of his tax returns.   While Trump is hiding his taxes, he's also proposing tax cuts for the wealthiest among us. It's a blatant attempt to line his own pockets at the expense of the American people - and it's just plain wrong."

For years now, Republican leaders in Congress have attempted to defund this essential healthcare provider, which serves millions of women nationwide, including nearly 12,000 Granite Staters. Why weren’t the Republican senators who supported the resolution willing to come to the Senate floor to defend their action, which jeopardizes essential care for millions of women?

President Trump seems to think that we have to endanger these coastlines and wild places to grow the economy, that energy development and environmental protection are somehow at odds. That's a dangerously outmoded way of thinking, one that disregards the concerns of dozens of coastal communities that have voiced bipartisan opposition to offshore drilling.

2564,RepRichHudson,Republican,"Today, the House voted to overturn Title X abortion funding rule, which effectively forces states to administer Title X health care funding to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. The federal government should not use taxpayer money to support abortion providers, and it shouldn’t force states to either.

2566,RepRobWittman,Republican,"Tonight President Trump has a great opportunity to lay out a bold agenda for his Administration and for the Republican majorities in Congress. He was elected to office largely on the promise that he will change business as usual in Washington and I look forward to joining him in that effort.    I am hopeful he explains how his defense budget proposal will allow our service men and women to meet the myriad of challenges we face around the world and that he specifically commits to ensuring adequate resources are devoted to shipbuilding and maintenance. I hope he also takes the time to lay out his vision for immigration and refugee policies that strike the proper balance between the safety and security of our nation and our fundamental belief that we should be welcoming to those who seek a better future for themselves and their families. I hope President Trump outlines a viable path forward for repealing the flawed portions of the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with patient-provider centered reforms that expand choices, increase access, and reduce costs. Finally, we must continue to focus on increasing economic growth and spurring job creation. I hope he details his views on reforming the tax code, removing burdensome regulations the stifle job growth, and encouraging companies to invest and grow their operations here in America.    The campaign is over. Now it is time to govern. I look forward to hearing tonight's speech and finding areas where I can work with the Trump Administration and my colleagues in Congress to ensure a safer, more prosperous future."

2574,chrismurphyct,Democrat,"Today, I congratulate President Trump on his inauguration and I give thanks to President Obama for his extraordinary presidency.   I know how you're feeling. This isn't the inauguration any of us hoped for. And like you, I am worried about the future of our country.  But I know that my fear is nothing compared to the fear many families across the country are feeling right now. I am not going to lose my health care. No one is trying to deport the Murphys of Connecticut. And as a white man from the northeast, there is no systematic effort to deny my reproductive or voting rights.  But here's my promise to you: I am going to fight for those families every single day. Because that's our choice right now; we can give into our despair, or we can fight.   I choose to fight.  Like many of you, I am not entirely sure what the next days, weeks, months and years will hold. But I do know that the only way forward is if we stand together.   Today, I truly wish Trump well, because his fate is now tied to the fate of our nation. I will work with him if he changes course and chooses a path that brings the country together. But if he pursues the divisive, hurtful policies that he made a hallmark of his campaign, I'll fight him with every ounce of my being.   Nothing is inevitable. Nothing is impossible. Take the anxiety, fear, and sadness you feel today and turn it into political action."

This act completely ignores the reality that birth control is health care. Today I’m introducing legislation that would prevent the president’s misguided, ill-informed interim final rules from having any force of law.

2650,RepRickCrawford,Republican,"As the number of Representatives from rural areas decrease and the number from urban areas increase, agriculture advocates must increasingly unify and communicate how the farm bill affects other policy areas. First, food security is national security. A net-importing nation that can’t feed itself is dangerously dependent on foreign nations, and Americans who either can’t access or can’t afford nutritional foodstuffs have trouble feeding their families or productively participating in the economy. Second, trade is critical for producers during these times of low farm income: we’ve got to work consistently towards opening new foreign markets for U.S. agriculture, new markets like Cuba. And third, we should not attempt to split the nutrition part of the bill from the farm title. Without support from urban Representatives who fully back the nutrition title, we’d never have enough support to get the farm title passed. #farmbill #agriculture  http://www.southwestfarmpress.com/peanuts/budget-will-dictate-farm-bill-debate"

2665,RepAnnaEshoo,Democrat,"The appointment of Steve Bannon to the National Security Council is outrageous. As an eight year veteran of the House Intelligence Committee, I know full well that to leave out our nation’s top military official, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) who oversees the entire intelligence community, substantially weakens our national security. I’m aghast that the new President would place a person without any experience on this critical panel and leave out two of the most critical."

2669,RepPeterDeFazio,Democrat,"For the last seven years, all we've heard from the GOP about the Affordable Care Act has been ""Repeal and Replace."" Now, President Trump has moved on to ""Destroy and Smirk."" Yesterday he took away premium support for thousands of low-income families and shortsightedly allowed plans to be sold across state lines with no regulation--something Congress banned 25 years ago. If President Trump actually has a plan to fix American healthcare, I'd love to see it. In the meantime, he seems intent upon unraveling much-needed protections for thousands of American families while ignoring the terrible damage he is inflicting upon the health insurance marketplace."

2688,RepSteveChabot,Republican,"On our way back to Cincinnati from the Inauguration, my wife Donna and I stopped by my alma mater, the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.  While there, I took this selfie in front of the Sir Christopher Wren Building on campus.  Built between 1695 and 1700, the Wren Building is the oldest American college building still in use.  The design of the building has been attributed to famed English mathematician and architect,  Sir Christopher Wren, hence its name.  Wren is best known for rebuilding much of London after the great fire in 1666.  The most renowned structure Wren rebuilt during that period was St. Paul's Cathedral, to which Wren added a dome which was, in turn, the inspiration for the dome of the U.S. Capitol Building.    I also snapped this photo of a statue in Williamsburg of Thomas Jefferson drafting the Declaration of Independence.  The connection?  Jefferson lived in the Wren Building while a student at William & Mary.  Jefferson attended William & Mary a few years before I did."

2708,RepAnnaEshoo,Democrat,"I do not support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch and here is why:  His judicial record is one which is antithetical to the values of my constituents: the protection of healthcare for women; consumer rights; the protection of our environment.  Judge Gorsuch’s decisions have gone directly against the rights of women both in their careers and in their personal lives. In the Hobby Lobby case, he joined the majority in stripping reproductive rights from women in the workplace. By continuously supporting defunding Planned Parenthood, millions of women are left without essential healthcare services to detect breast cancer, cervical cancer and other special medical screenings vital to women.  Judge Gorsuch has consistently voted against consumers, including in Strickland vs. UPS, where he dissented to a ruling giving a female UPS driver a chance to prove sex discrimination. Just last year, Judge Gorsuch ruled against a consumer who was wrongly charged hundreds of dollars in Elizabeth Hammond vs. Stamps.com, making it easier for companies to move their case to federal court, a move that favors big businesses and harms consumers.  He has embraced a radical legal doctrine that would allow the courts to overrule agency experts implementing regulations to protect the American people. These laws would allow judges to overrule essential protections for Americans put in place by agencies involving the environment, essential workers’ rights and safeguards for consumers.  If approved by the Senate, Judge Gorsuch’s decisions will affect the American people for decades to come. His record is far outside the judicial mainstream and the American people deserve better than a far right wing, activist judge that has a record of choosing the most powerful interests over those of extraordinary, ordinary Americans."

2757,RepGeneGreen,Democrat,"Trumpcare is back and it’s worse than ever.    Just when we thought the Republican Majority abandoned their attempts to rip health care away from millions of Americans, they’ve come back with a last-ditch effort that would do even more damage. The Graham-Cassidy bill being considered by the Senate would mean far worse care, far fewer Americans covered, and much higher costs. The bill punishes low-income families, seniors, older Americans, people with disabilities, veterans, and women. It also punishes states that did the right thing for their citizens by expanding the Medicaid program.  I urge the Republican Majority to abandon their misguided and cruel attempts to rip away health care, and instead work with Democrats on ways to provide quality affordable health care for all. Until then, I won’t stop fighting to protect our care."

2762,RepAdamSchiff,Democrat,"Almost 24 hours after General Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor – and by Sean Spicer's own admission – we now know that the President has known for weeks that Flynn lied about his contact with the Russian Ambassador. And for weeks he allowed the public to be misled. The President only acted to force Flynn out when the public learned about the true nature of Fynn's contact with the Russians.   This needs to be investigated. The U.S. is in a global struggle with Russia, which is pushing its brand of authoritarian rule in Europe and beyond. Freedom loving people everywhere are counting on America to champion liberty and democracy, and we need to stand up to the Kremlin and its pernicious influence.  We cannot do this if the Administration has been compromised, as Flynn had been by his own dishonesty.    Congress has a solemn responsibility to do its oversight and investigate these issues. If Speaker Ryan won’t commit to a full congressional investigation, he needs to get out of the way and allow for an independent commission to handle the matter."

The restored wetlands help keep phosphorus from entering the Lake, and that helps prevent large-scale algal bloom outbreaks, like the one that caused Toledo’s water crisis in the summer of 2014. It also stops harmful bacteria from getting to the beaches at the state park. That’s a problem that has shut down our beaches in the past. The GLRI has been proven to work to protect Lake Erie, something that is critical to Ohio’s fishing industry, our tourism industry, and the drinking water of 3 million Ohioans.   After touring the wetlands, I visited The University of Toledo Lake Center. GLRI funds have benefited Lake Erie Center by supporting $5.7 million of research and monitoring.

The discussion focused on the aftermath of the Supreme Court case Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v.

The roundtable also included discussion of legislation that would help veteran-owned small businesses, including veteran-owned businesses in American Samoa.  “Many of my fellow Committee members, some of whom are veterans themselves, are committed to making sure the law is upheld and the VA is truly putting veterans first,” said House Chairman Steve Chabot.  “I have the honor of sitting on the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Small Business Committee.

2789,CongressmanWarrenDavidson,Republican,"Pointing to the wisdom in our founding documents, and the relevance of Franklin's ""A republic if you can keep it"" response, Rabbi Sachs shared these thoughts in a recent speech. Who must keep the republic? ""We, the people""  ""In a contract, two or more people come together to make an exchange. . . . And so you have the commercial contract that creates the market and the social contract that creates the state.  A covenant isn’t like that. It’s more like a marriage than an exchange. In a covenant, two or more parties each respecting the dignity and integrity of the other come together in a bond of loyalty and trust to do together what neither can do alone. A covenant isn’t about me. It’s about us. A covenant isn’t about interests. It’s about identity. A covenant isn’t about me, the voter, or me, the consumer, but about all of us together. Or in that lovely key phrase of American politics, it’s about “we, the people.”  The market is about the creation and distribution of wealth. The state is about the creation and distribution of power. But a covenant is about neither wealth nor power, but about the bonds of belonging and of collective responsibility. And to put it as simply as I can, the social contract creates a state but the social covenant creates a society.  Biblical Israel had a society long before it had a state, before it even crossed the Jordan and enter the land, which explains why Jews were able to keep their identity for 2,000 years in exile and dispersion because although they’d lost their state, they still had their society. Although they’d lost their contract, they still had their covenant. And there is only one nation known to me that had the same dual founding as biblical Israel, and that is the United States of America which had its social covenant in the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and its social contract in the Constitution in 1787. . . .  Listen to this sentence. See how odd it might sound to anyone but an American. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.” Those truths are anything but self-evident. They would have been unintelligible to Plato, to Aristotle, or to every hierarchical society the world has ever known. They are self-evident only to people, to Jews and Christians, who have internalized the Hebrew Bible. And that is what made G. K. Chesterton call America “a nation with the soul of a church.""   America understands more clearly than any other Western nation that freedom requires not just a state, but also and even more importantly a society, a society built of strong covenantal institutions, of marriages, families, congregations, communities, charities, and voluntary associations. . . .  In America, the social contract is still there, but the social covenant is being lost. . . . ""."

TrumpCare takes health care away from 24 million Americans, while the rest of us pay more for fewer benefits. Older Americans will be especially hurt, and people with pre-existing conditions will be put at risk. This bill offends my conscience and hurts my constituents, and so I voted no.  I want every American to have access to quality, affordable health care, but this bill falls far short of that goal. We should work in a bipartisan way to strengthen what works in the Affordable Care Act and fix what doesn’t – not dismantle our health care system with a hyper-partisan bill negotiated behind closed doors and passed without a single public hearing or cost analysis.  “Virtually all patient advocates, physicians, hospitals, and independent health care experts, including the AARP, opposed this bill.

But the strategy was quickly thrown in doubt as it became clear House GOP leadership did not have the votes to get the bill through the chamber… Meanwhile, the clock is ticking down on government funding.” Republicans in Congress reneged on their assurances to fund children’s health care and protect our DREAM Act students.

2820,reppeteaguilar,Democrat,I was glad to see Republicans and Democrats come together to oppose a reckless bill that would strip millions of health care coverage. We need to have an open process with bipartisan support to improve the Affordable Care Act so it works for all Americans. Fixing our health care system shouldn’t be about keeping a campaign promise – it’s about doing what’s right for American families.
2821,GwenSMoore,Democrat,My constituents and I have a question for House Republicans and Senate GOP: What exactly are your priorities? Because all we see is a group of people skirting their responsibilities and refusing to hold Donald J. Trump accountable. It's time to #WakeUpGOP!

These are but two examples.  We believe the U.S. military is best positioned to save lives, meet immediate needs of the people with food and water, set up a functioning telecommunications system and establish medical triage and emergency medical services.  Our military servicemen and women are the best in the world and their fellow citizens in Puerto Rico need their help desperately.

One of the most important factors preventing seniors from continuing to age in place is ensuring the home is safe. The best way to begin this task is by preparing a home safety checklist. The checklist is a great way to carefully and closely assess an entire living space and determine where potential hazards could arise.  As a presenter from the AARP noted, the best time to prepare your home for life as a senior is twenty years ago.

2868,RepSanfordSC,Republican,"1 Corinthians 9:24 says, “Do you not know that all the runners in a race compete, but only one receives the prize? So run your race so as to obtain the prize.”   What’s interesting about that Bible verse is that it applies to a whole lot more than running races...it’s an admonition on life. What’s further interesting is that it applies not just to any of us individually but as well to all of us collectively.   Which brings me around to yesterday’s vote on tax reform. Part of what tipped the scales from my end was the degree to which we have to both cut spending and grow the economy to have any chance of getting out of the mathematical pickle we’re working ourselves into as a country.  In this regard, the Tax Foundation recently released their annual International Tax Competitive Index that ranks the 35 so-called developed countries according to their tax code on the aspects of competitiveness and neutrality. A competitive and neutral tax code is one that accomplishes three things: promotes economic growth, encourages investment over savings, and raises enough money to fund the government programs that exist.   This year, for the second year in a row, the United States came in at number 30 overall. Think about that...out of the 35 so-called developed nations, the United States ranks almost dead last. Indeed, we’re hardly winning this race.  To see more of how we’re doing, take a look at the link below….  I’d love your thoughts."

2872,RepWilson,Democrat,"Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson issued the following statement on the release of dozens of Chibok Girls:  “I was elated to learn this evening that dozens of Chibok girls have been released three years and three weeks after being abducted by the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram. My joy is bittersweet, however, because once the names of those freed have been announced, many families will experience a crushing disappointment that will be compounded by the uncertainty of whether their girls are even still alive.  “Since this nightmare began on April 14, 2014, 57 of the 276 girls that Boko Haram kidnapped escaped that night. In May 2016, another was found wandering in a forest in May 2016, and last October, 21 Chibok schoolgirls were released as a result of negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, with the aid of the government of Switzerland.  “As the details of this most recent release continue to unfold, we must remain diligent in the fight for the release of the young women still being held by Boko Haram. It is important that Nigerian government officials know that the world is both watching and waiting for their return and I am confident that such pressure helps keep them vigilant.  “On December 14, 2016, legislation that Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and I sponsored to combat Boko Haram and address the impact of its insurgency became Public Law 114-266. It directs the U.S. secretaries of State and Defense to jointly develop a five-year strategy to aid the Nigerian government, members of the Multinational Joint Task Force created to combat Boko Haram, and international partners who’ve offered their support to counter the regional threat posed by Boko Haram. The strategy also must address the severe famine, humanitarian and education crises created by Boko Haram.    “The five-year strategy is due on June 12, 2017. It also is the deadline for the director of National Intelligence to assess the willingness and capability of Nigeria and its regional partners to implement the strategies outlined. It is critical that they don’t miss this urgent deadline.  “Today’s news once again underscores why we have to keep pushing and pressing and doing everything we can to ensure that the Chibok schoolgirls are not forgotten—and why we must never stop believing that we will bring back our girls.”"

For years, the federal government has spent beyond its means, and yesterday’s report from the Congressional Budget Office is yet another indication of that fact. The report projects that for the first time in nearly a decade, deficits are expected to rise, reaching $1 trillion by 2023 and putting the federal government on track to borrow another $9.4 trillion over the next 10 years.   This trajectory is more than just unpleasant on paper; it is advance notice of a much bigger storm headed our way, if Congress fails to get our financial house in order.

Nearly all of those killed were LGBTQ, more than half of the victims were part of Central Florida's vibrant Puerto Rican diaspora. The LGBTQ community was heartbroken. The Latino community was shaken. And our entire nation was at yet another crossroads when it came to the issue of gun violence.   One year later, our nation’s wounds have yet to heal, and we have yet to take meaningful action to honor the victims. The Pulse nightclub shooting was the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter in American history, and despite Democratic filibusters and sit-ins, Congressional Republicans have spent the last year blocking common sense gun reform. I’m talking about background checks. I’m talking about banning large ammunition magazines designed for shooting en masse. These are simply common-sense reforms. They are not controversial, they will protect the most vulnerable among us, and they do not violate the Second Amendment.   How many prayers must be said? How many vigils must we have? How many moments of silence before we get serious about stopping gun violence in this country? Inaction is acceptance.

2912,RepGrothman,Republican,"During town halls last week, I talked to many constituents who were concerned about the sexual harassment happening in Congress, as well as the seemingly secret payments regarding sexual harassment.

2914,JohnBoozman,Republican,"The Senate voted today to send a bill to the president that will fund the government through the remainder of Fiscal Year 2017.  While far from perfect, the bill we passed keeps the government funded for the remainder of the fiscal year while addressing a number of the most pressing issues facing our nation.  The bill prioritizes our national security by increasing defense spending so that we can focus on rebuilding our military and includes the biggest boost to border security in a decade.  On the domestic side, it fully funds newly created programs to help states address the devastating opioid and heroin epidemic that is sweeping the nation while halting any new funding for Obamacare and reining in EPA regulations.      It is my hope that we can build on this momentum moving forward and make it a priority to pass all twelve appropriations bills on an annual basis. Cooperation and regular order in the Senate will help our country build a path of success for the future, open more doors to projects important to Arkansas and go a long way toward fixing the broken system in Washington."

2918,RepMcSally,Republican,"Nearly six years ago, our community changed forever when 19 people were shot as Representative Giffords met with her constituents. This attack on our democracy resulted in six deaths, including the first assassination of a congressional staffer, Gabe Zimmerman, in the line of duty. While the pain and grief for those we lost will always be with us, we also remember how Tucson came together to show courage, compassion, and unity.   On Friday, I will introduce a bill along with Senators McCain and Flake to designate the January 8th Memorial in Tucson a permanent national memorial. Our community’s response in the face of this tragedy stood as an example of love for the entire country, and in designating this memorial, we move one step closer to permanently enshrining that spirit and the memory of those killed."

Well, I can tell you that dozens of real, living Connecticut residents have been calling our offices this morning to express their outrage over the FCC's attempt to tamper with their internet access. Please know that I stand with you.  Even on a holiday week, our voices won't be silenced. While I wish we were discussing ways to expand internet access, not limit it, it gives me some hope to see democracy alive and well."

I’ve been there, I’ve seen it, I’ve lived it, and quite frankly I’m sick of it. We need to do what we can to stop it.   Tonight I participated in a Special Order on the House Floor to speak against nonconsensual photo sharing in the Military. We discussed PRIVATE Act, my bill which will define when private photo sharing is a military criminal act—which is not clear in current law. This bill has broad bipartisan support with 27 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. Together we can stand in the gap for others. Learn more: https://goo.gl/7tgo9Q"

When I got there, some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle were trying to undermine the Mueller investigation into Russia's influence on the 2016 election. We know for a fact that Russia tried to influence the election on behalf of the current president, and I won't stand idly by while anyone tries to prime the pump for obstruction of justice."

It was shameful in 1942 and it is shameful today. We must always uphold the American principle of liberty and justice for all.
2932,RepByrne,Republican,"Over the last year, the American economy has really boomed due to renewed optimism, a fairer regulatory environment, a simplified tax code, and much more. I’m proud of what we have been able to accomplish in just one year, but more opportunities are ahead!"
2933,SenatorKaine,Democrat,"In 1986, President Ronald Reagan knew that tax reform should be the product of bipartisan work. Many Republicans in Congress call Reagan their political hero. But the GOP is not measured by who it says is its hero. It’s measured by its actions. And this 2017 tax bill isn’t in the mold of Reagan, it’s in the mold of President Trump. Say one thing, and do another."
2934,judgecarter,Republican,Today the House passed two pieces of important legislation to ensure our immigration laws are enforced and keep our communities safe.    → #KatesLaw helps prevent unlawful immigrants who commit serious crimes from becoming repeat offenders that put communities at risk.   → The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act provides tools to combat dangerous sanctuary city policies that permit criminals to go free.
2935,Keith.Ellison,Democrat,"Every day, the Trump administration attacks something that we as Minnesotans hold dear – inclusion, fairness, peace, economic equality. The cronies he tapped to run the Environmental Protection Agency are doing to the same thing to our environment. Whether hacking entire programs, eliminating thousands of vital positions, rolling back rules that fought climate change, gutting science advisory panels, or stacking the agency with industry shills, it’s clear that Trump’s EPA is trying to do everything but protect the environment.  Despite the current situation, there is reason to hope. Come and join Congressman Ellison along with environmental advocates, scientists, and musicians to learn about Trump’s plan for the EPA and how we’re fighting back in Congress."

2956,RepJuanVargas,Democrat,"I led the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in calling for the removal of USCIS Ombudsman, Julie Kirchner. Her appointment is a huge mistake because it brings fear into the homes of many people who feel that are not going to be treated in a way that respects their constitutional rights. We do not believe that a person who has spent over a decade attacking immigrant communities will now work effectively and thoughtfully to advance the rights of immigrants and fulfill the important duties that are required of this role."
2957,RepDebbieDingell,Democrat,"An important conversation happening today at 6 p.m. at Huron High School. Join Washtenaw Sheriff Jerry Clayton and an excellent group of panelists to ask questions and receive updates on efforts to address the opioid epidemic, substance use disorders, and other key issues. This town hall, the third in a series, will specifically focus on how mental health, substance use and the opioid crisis are impacting young people in Washtenaw County.  It is critical that we come together as a community to learn, provide input, and discuss how we can address this crisis, which is impacting too many of our families. These conversations are crucial to that goal."
2958,SenatorWhitehouse,Democrat,"In a small state like Rhode Island, just about everyone knows a family that has been touched by the opioid epidemic. We wrote the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act after years of collaborating with the team at CODAC Behavioral Healthcare and others on the front lines of the opioid addiction crisis in Rhode Island to make sure we got it right. The bipartisan legislation put in place powerful tools to prevent addiction, improve treatment, and support recovery, and we need to make sure these programs are properly funded to further turn the tide of this public health crisis and save lives."

2972,repsheaporter,Democrat,"White nationalism is dangerous, despicable and has no place in our country. We must all strongly and specifically denounce today's racist, un-American violence in Charlottesville. There are not many sides to this story. This is clear evil.  The cowards who are waving Nazi flags in Virginia today are free thanks to my parents' generation of Nazi fighters. During World War II my dad's ship was hit by Nazis. Two hundred American sailors died, but he fought on. My uncle flew daylight bombing missions over Germany. My mom worked in a shipyard. Today I can speak out against fascism because they and their generation were heroes who saved us from Nazis."
2973,RepLowenthal,Democrat,"It pains me to see senseless hatred and vandalism at Jewish cemeteries last week in St. Louis and over the weekend in Philadelphia. These acts, like the recent string of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers across the nation, are born out of ignorance and bigotry. The perpetrators should be condemned loudly, by every American. Their hateful message has no place in our country."

2975,RepTomSuozzi,Democrat,"These are dark times. Terrorism, war, threats, and now white supremacists preaching and practicing hate in America.   We must reaffirm the fundamental principles of our nation's founding. All men and women are created equal. We must promote the intrinsic worth of every human being. We must combat the haters with love and with strength. America is far from perfect, but we must strive for her to be more perfect.  Our president, our leader and all leaders cannot equivocate or misdirect. Hate and haters must be condemned and, where appropriate, dealt with. Every legal remedy at our disposal and every opportunity to promote our basic values must be used to advance the cause of liberty and justice for all.  Nothing less is acceptable. This is our ""republic, if we can keep it."" We must all work together to preserve and enhance our precious gift of America. Now and forever. ������������"

2978,timryan,Democrat,"This non-partisan report proves that Trumpcare will rip healthcare away from 24 million Americans, and leave 52 million without any insurance. This is perhaps the most brazen example yet of President Trump telling voters one thing, and then doing something different. Voters in my state did not cast their ballots to inflict this harm on millions of their fellow neighbors. Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans may think that the number of Americans covered is beside the point. I say it is exactly the point.   These are real people. These are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters who get sick and want nothing more than to see their family member get better. Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for even introducing this dangerous legislation. The number one priority for any national healthcare policy should be how to cover more people and how to improve the coverage they receive. Trumpcare does neither and is moving us in the wrong direction."
2979,8037068318.0,Democrat,"The Trump Administration’s decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 2,500 Nicaraguans living in the U.S. and delay a decision on the status of 57,000 Hondurans is a heartless move that will rip families apart and inflict harm on some of our most vulnerable neighbors.  These immigrants have lived here for two decades, planting roots in their communities and contributing to local economies.  Abruptly asking them to leave is morally unconscionable and makes for bad policy. I will continue pushing my legislation, the American Promise Act, HR 4253, which would afford these hardworking immigrants Legal Permanent Residence and create an opportunity for citizenship."

2981,SenatorKamalaHarris,Democrat,"In celebration of Immigrant Heritage Month, I’d like to share some Californians' stories with you all. Meet Itzel:   “I graduated from high school three days before DACA was announced. At the time, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to afford to go to college, but I was very enthusiastic to be able to work and serve my community. For me, applying for DACA was a risk worth taking. I graduated from San Diego State University this year and started working at Alliance San Diego. We help the immigrant community with things like access to qualified legal services and assistance for naturalization. In my work and in my community, I see the toll that harsh immigration enforcement has every day. I think many times, in the midst of the rhetoric, we lose sight of the real impact these policies have on people’s lives. I’m fully committed to continuing to serve my community and building a movement that gives immigrants, refugees, and citizens the right to live with dignity in the United States.”  #ImmigrantHeritageMonth"

The auto industry is one of the main drivers of Ohio’s economy, employing more than 108,000 Ohioans and contributing more than $13 billion annually to our economy. At plants like the Parma Metal Center, I can see why Ohio is a leader in automobile manufacturing. I saw firsthand how our workers are at the cutting edge of innovation and development.

Let us never forget that we are the land of the free because of the sacrifice of the brave.                                               --   My office is happy to assist veterans and their families who have lost, or were never awarded their medals.

3004,RepMarkWalker,Republican,"It was a week that we will all remember, especially my teammates that survived this tragic attack on our practice facility.  It's been sobering processing the realization that our entire team had been part of an assassination plot over the last several weeks. We had witnessed this guy lurking around our field in the early morning hours but never thought he would be capable of such a heinous act.   On several occasions, I have thought about how my position on the pitcher's mound would have placed me very close to the shooter, had I still been present on the field when the first shots were fired.   On paper, it should have been much worse. At our team meeting, we acknowledged the heroic acts of both members as well as the agents who saved the lives of members and staff. Yet, we believe God protected the team from a massacre due in large part to the people lifting us up in prayer each and every day.  I was honored to all members of Congress in prayer in the congressional auditorium shortly after the shooting. Prayer was also important enough for both Republicans and Democrats to join on bended knee asking for God's guidance, protection and healing for Rep. Steve Scalise.   At the game, Cedric Richmond and the Democrats were more than we could handle at the Nationals Park, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention several of my Democrat colleagues who have extended genuine concern over these last few days of sobering reality.  As I have stated, leaders must be disciplined in their rhetoric and speech. I have said from the beginning that tone matters. President Reagan was an example proving it is possible to accomplish both: stand up for our values and beliefs while exhibiting grace and statesmanship.  We live in a new time where anger and hate is being spewed at a feverish pitch. Even today, there are tweets and posts against me expressing that I am ""ok hurting children."" One man is even using #HuntRepublicanCongressmen in his messaging.   I am not a victim; rather, I am privileged to serve in this capacity and will continue to stand firm on my positions of advocating for unborn children, limiting government in our daily lives, advocating for personal responsibility, and protecting our citizens with a strong national defense.   Your support and prayers allow me to continue these efforts and I am truly grateful - especially this week!"
3005,jiminhofe,Republican,"Today I met with Ralph Gigliotti, director of Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Region 19 and Mark Morgan, director of the Muskogee VA Health Care System. We discussed a VA Inspector General (IG) report released this week on an investigation into the Muskogee VA. While Director Morgan has made some great improvements at Muskogee, this report makes clear there is still room for improvement to ensure our VA hospitals provide quality healthcare to our veterans. Our VA hospitals should be held to the same standards as private hospitals and outside oversight is the best way to achieve that. VISN directors, like Gigliotti, should be empowered to contract with outside entities to conduct investigations into their facilities and my bill, S. 1266, the Enhancing Veteran Care Act would allow them to do just that. I worked closely with Director Gigliotti last year to replace the VA Directors in the Muskogee and Oklahoma City systems when it was clear the leadership at our VAs failed our Oklahoma veterans. I am very impressed with Gigliotti’s leadership and his willingness to do what it takes to reform and improve how our veterans receive healthcare. We had a productive meeting today and I am looking forward to continuing our partnership on veterans issues."

3016,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"Republicans are back singing the same tune, but this next verse is as bad as the last. The latest Republican repeal bill finds new ways to cut health care from older Americans, disabled children, and working low-income families. They are rushing this to a vote despite not knowing how many would lose insurance and how much premiums would increase. Instead of more of the same, we must stabilize health care, not sabotage it. We must continue working together to tell our stories of the harm this approach will cause to many. Health care for millions continues to hang by a thread in this hostile Congress."

Our schools need a real commitment and investment from this administration.   Despite the buildup, this Executive Order doesn’t include details about federal agency funding, grants, or contracts. This action on HBCUs is not sufficient to hold up to promises made by this administration. Our schools need substantial policy changes and increased funding to create a real impact on their campuses-not just a photo op in the Oval office.   As we establish national priorities through the budget, we must protect public education, bolster and expand Pell Grants, and give schools and students the means to be successful. I will work with the administration, HBCUs, and my colleagues to move forward with legislation that will provide HBCUs with the tools and resources they need to thrive."

3038,RepDWS,Democrat,"I created the annual “Make Her Mark” Award last year to celebrate young women in South Florida whose actions and contributions will inspire others for years to come. One young woman really captured the spirit of the award this year. It's Samirah Khan, who selflessly gives back by feeding the homeless and volunteering countless hours for children with a wide range of disabilities such as Autism, OCD, and Down’s syndrome. Samirah’s been involved with student government since her freshman year, and helped on such projects as homecoming, spirit days, pep rallies and custodial appreciation day. She's also a National Honor Society member and tutor. Samirah has faced her own obstacles. In November she was diagnosed with cancer.  Even though she’s had to take time off from the groups she loves participating in, she’s still around to lend a helping hand.  And she’s still excelling in her Advanced Placement classes. As a cancer survivor myself, who worked straight on through the year of hell I went through to make it to the other side, I know the fire that burns inside Samirah, to keep going and to keep focusing on helping others. I was so proud to honor Samirah this morning. She's certainly making her mark."

As Congress works to pass federal spending bills this week, I will continue to advocate for strong investment in Workforce Innovation and Opportunity programs, which provide job search, education, and training activities for individuals to secure new jobs.

He walked me through how he would conduct himself on the bench and how he sees the Supreme Court's role in our constitutional democracy. He stressed that a judge should interpret the law as it's written, not impose his beliefs on the people. And he showed a profound respect for the Constitution.

3057,SenatorSasse,Republican,"As we celebrate 150 years of Nebraska statehood this month, we tell the stories of the pioneers, caretakers of the land, statesmen, and volunteers who have made our state so great. Today's story: Let's start with the millions of men and women who settled Nebraska when it was known as the “Great American Desert”. In 1846, an explorer described the state as a “barren, trackless waste...” That changed with the Homestead Act.  The Homestead Act made made land ownership accessible to anyone, from married men to divorced or widowed women, former slaves, and even immigrants. People of totally different backgrounds and means could legally own 160 acres of American land.  Of course, there was a catch.  The Homestead Act gave settlers property deeds only after they worked and lived on the land for five years. Your background didn’t matter. Your care of the land, did.  Homesteaders struggled through droughts, blizzards, floods, and plagues. Many didn’t last five years. The ones who did, cultivated the land and grew relationships with their neighbors. By 1900, almost 69,000 people had claimed land in Nebraska under the Homestead Act, the largest number of any state in the Union."
3058,JackieSpeier,Democrat,"This week in Through the Legislative Looking Glass, nothing is what it seems. The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives is pushing through the “Veterans 2nd Amendment Act,” (H.R. 1181) which in reality puts veterans having mental health crises at grave risk of suicide by firearm.    H.R. 1181 would enable Veterans Affairs beneficiaries who suffer from severe mental illness to buy firearms. The so-called “Veterans 2nd Amendment Act” ends the current process of having the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs submit certain mental health records to the national background check system. However, veterans on this list have the same Second Amendment rights as everyone else – there is already a due process system in place that provides them with the opportunity to appeal decisions that deny them of their right to a firearm.    Selling guns to veterans undergoing mental health crises with no questions asked is dangerous and shortsighted. Suicide among veterans has risen sharply, and suicide among female veterans has increased by 85% since 2001. More than 20 U.S. veterans kill themselves each day, and more than two in three of those suicides are carried out with firearms.    Instead of passing a bill that puts our veterans at greater risk of death by suicide, I urge my colleagues to pass the “Fix Gun Checks Act,” which I introduced last Congress. This bill makes Americans safer by requiring a background check for every gun sale, including at trade shows and online, which would save countless lives."

I also welcome the President's announcement of a broad strategy to push back on Iran's support of terrorism, its imperial aggression, and its oppression of the Iranian people. The Iran deal disfigured our wider policy toward Iran, because President Obama was so scared that Iran would scuttle the deal that he pulled his punches on other issues.

In an extremely concerning and unprecedented move, he made Chief Strategist and former white supremacist publisher Stephen Bannon a member of the NSC while removing the CIA Director, Director of National Intelligence, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as regular attendees.  The decisions made by the National Security Council are crucial to our national safety and sovereignty.

3110,repdanlipinski,Democrat,"Last month I opposed the AHCA, a bill in the House that would leave over 23 million people without insurance coverage compared to current law.  After promising improvements to the House bill, the Senate released a draft today that appears to largely follow the House legislation.  Unfortunately, it appears the Senate bill would make even more cuts to healthcare in the long run, in a way that would be especially harmful to Illinois residents.  Over the past few weeks, I have heard from numerous families in my district who are distressed by what might happen to them if a bill like the AHCA becomes the law of the land.  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take great care and not repeat the House’s mistake in rushing a vote on legislation without a complete independent fiscal analysis or fully considering what this proposal would mean in practice for millions of families worried about finding high-quality insurance coverage and getting the care they need."

3115,95696782238.0,Democrat,"The reason that TrumpCare keeps falling apart is because it is cruel. It is simply not realistic to gut programs like Medicaid or end the essential health benefits that tens of millions of people rely upon. TrumpCare puts partisan grandstanding ahead of realistic reforms.   Even after this failure, Congressional Republicans briefly went back to the ‘repeal-only’ approach that would strip healthcare coverage from 32 million people. Given that they have spent the last seven years trashing the Affordable Care Act, it is baffling to me that those pushing repeal haven’t learned a thing. Just hours after announcing this new strategy, the ‘repeal-only’ approach has already fallen apart.    There is no question that improvements to healthcare need to be made. Reforms can be enacted in a matter of weeks, if not days. But when bipartisanship is used as a threat, as Senate Majority Leader McConnell has done in the past, it underscores how the Republican Party isn’t interested in working across the aisle even as people are asking for help.   Democrats won’t let the Republican Party destroy healthcare, but we will work together to improve the system. Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell should work with both Democrats and Republicans to draft a bill that works for all Americans."

3120,repdavereichert,Republican,"As I’ve said previously, the organizer’s behind Saturday’s protest in Charlottesville, VA are committed to causes inspired by hate, bigotry, and selfishness. Let me be clear, there is no defense for the KKK or white supremacists and the racist views they stand for and they must be condemned universally and decisively. The greatest weapon to organizations founded in hate and the desire to divide, is Americans’ pursuit of unity, acceptance, and love for one another. From our earliest days to this past weekend, these values have been challenged and tested, but they have remained constant as an American ideal. As we mourn the senseless loss of life in Charlottesville and consider how to move forward as a nation, we must confront racists with what they fear most by continuing to work toward this ideal. With tensions high in communities across the country, progress can only come with the recognition we are all on the same team, a willingness to walk in each other’s shoes, and a common goal of regaining trust and civility within our neighborhoods and throughout the country. We must all learn to live together as brothers and sisters, as Dr. Martin Luther King said, or we will all perish together as fools."

No matter how you repackage it, this new executive order is still immoral, discriminatory, unconstitutional, and un-American. Furthermore, by removing Iraq from the list of banned nations, President Trump has exposed just how arbitrary this action truly is.    Doubling down on this shameful policy will not make America safer – rather, it will put Americans at risk. President Trump should take the hint from the countless Americans that protested the first time he took this un-American action that his misguided priorities are not who we are as a nation.   Rather than attempting to distract the American public, the President must answer for his Attorney General’s act of perjury before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his reckless and unsubstantiated wiretapping claims, and his administration’s ties to the Russian government.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Summer Food Service Program provides meals for children during summer months. Unfortunately, the funding does not always last for the entire summer. To make up for the three week gap in funds at the end of the summer, the Grand Forks community through United Lutheran Church was able to raise funds to make sure these children have meals that fuel them through their summer activities. For some children, the summer lunch programs may provide the only meal a child eats that day. This program is a wonderful example of a community coming together to fill a need."

Thousands of Granite Staters have received lifesaving substance misuse treatment thanks to Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act provision establishing mental health and substance misuse services as essential health benefits. However, these benefits are at great risk of being undone by the Republican’s healthcare repeal efforts. This new study is yet another reminder that, to combat the devastating opioid crisis, we must make mental health treatment affordable and accessible. Instead of undermining the progress we have made in combating the opioid epidemic, Congress should focus on improving mental health services and our nation’s opioid response. -- J.S."

We could allow this project to be done through the Corps of Engineers - but the reality is that there has only been one project finished over the past 20 years in Louisiana by the Corps (outside of post-Katrina projects, which were completed outside of normal circumstances). Bottom line is that waiting on the Corps is not a viable path; we've been doing that for 30 years.  The other option - the one we've been advocating for - puts the state parishes, the Amite River Basin Commission and others in the driver’s seat. We have identified $2 Billion in federal funds that have been brought to the state of Louisiana. Enough of those dollars could be used to not only advance, but to finish the Comite River Diversion Canal Project.

And it is being made worse by dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl and carfentanil coming in from overseas. The federal government can do its part by passing the bipartisan STOP Act and helping to prevent these drugs from being shipped to traffickers our communities. But ultimately, this crisis has to be solved at the local level. I have been to addiction treatment facilities all over Ohio and have seen firsthand the life-saving work being done by so many in our state. We have to all come together to help those in need get the treatment that they need. We have to remove the stigma and treat addiction like the disease that it is. Only together can we help turn the tide of this drug epidemic."

These are areas where lawmakers should be able to find agreement, but we need partners in the House and the Senate who are willing to look past the next election and work with us to tackle the big issues.

Phebe Mack, with her back to the camera, interpreted for me, translating American Sign Language from Anthony Natale, who appears on the screen from California. Natale, a community relations manager, is also an actor and his ASL was so expressive I was able to capture much of his meaning by simply watching.   Salt Lake City-based Sorenson Communications has over 100 centers in North America, employing about 5,000 video relay sign language interpreters, with 40 of  those in Meridian. The company also provides caption calling services and has about 900 employees in Meridian. I met with workers who talked about how they chose their profession. Many have deaf or hard-of-hearing relatives and some simply have an interest in improving communication.

Read my Press Release here:  Washington, D.C. –Wednesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata at a Natural Resources subcommittee hearing today, strenuously objected to the lack of local input, transparency and scientific scrutiny in the marine monument designation process.  The Congresswoman’s sentiments were echoed by her colleagues on the committee, as well as the majority of the expert panelists who were invited to participate.  “For over a millennium our people have fished these waters.  For some bureaucrat in Washington to make the decision to close off these vast swaths of ocean to our people without even consulting the local leadership or industry, so that they may appease their environmental masters, is unacceptable,” said Amata.  “The environmental colonialists have gone too far in expanding these protected areas, to the severe detriment of American Samoa, and I am glad that my colleagues on the committee have seen the need to address the issue,” continued the Congresswoman.  Most notably, the Remote Pacific Islands Marine Monument, which is part of American Samoa’s traditional fishing grounds, have been expanded and closed completely to U.S. fishing interests, while remaining open to our foreign competitors who fish for these migratory species without the conservation methods and regulations followed by our fishermen.  “I want to thank both Chairman Lamborn and Ranking Member Huffman for allowing me to participate in today’s subcommittee hearing, so that I could explain the importance of access to these waters for our fishing fleet, as well as Mr. Hallman, whose testimony today was very insightful,” concluded Amata."

As thousands in New Jersey brave the cold to head out to their favorite St. Patrick’s Day Parade this month, it is clearer than ever that this holiday is truly a symbol of the success of Irish-Americans in the nation.   For many in America of Irish ancestry, including thousands in my congressional district, St. Patrick’s Day is an opportunity to celebrate and honor the 35 million Americans who trace their heritage to Ireland. Those who immigrated to the United States from Ireland often faced great obstacles to achieve the American dream, but their determination and contributions undoubtingly make our country stronger.   The Irish-American experience is a reminder of the role that immigration has played in our nation’s story and it should inform our opinions as we debate our immigration policy today.   Ireland continues to be a beacon of democracy and prosperity in Europe and it is essential that the United States stands with its ally as we confront the 21st century. Brexit will undoubtedly bring about challenges for the emerald isle, but it should be made clear that Americans will stand with it during this uncertain time.

3249,RepPerlmutter,Democrat,"As part of the appropriations process, I cosponsored four bipartisan amendments this week to help address the marijuana banking crisis. These amendments work to block the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) from revoking their guidance for how financial institutions should provide banking services to legitimate marijuana businesses. In addition, the amendments prohibit federal funds from being used to penalize states with their own regulatory structure in place or financial institutions serving legitimate marijuana businesses.  I have helped introduce similar amendments over the past several years but House Republicans continue to deny the opportunity for a vote on any marijuana banking-related amendments. I’ve also introduced the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act which allows marijuana-related businesses in states with existing regulatory structures to access the banking system.  Currently, these small businesses are forced to operate on a cash-only basis, which poses a significant public safety threat in our communities. With eight states and Washington, D.C. now allowing for adult-use recreational marijuana and 29 states legalizing medical marijuana, it’s time for Congress to act."

3254,repfrankpallone,Democrat,Honored to have Jon Whiten as my guest for the Joint Session tonight. Listen to Jon explain what the Affordable Care Act (Act) has meant to his family. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHe4rB2-7Oc&feature=youtu.be
3255,RepJackBergman,Republican,To the ladies who make dreams possible ... Happy Mother's Day!
3256,RepLaMalfa,Republican,"Congratulations to my friend and former colleague Ryan Zinke on his confirmation to Secretary of Interior. He is a good man and a retired Navy Seal. We have already been talking about the issues affecting Northern California and why we need more dams, not less. He will be a great ally for me and the issues important to a vibrant North State."
3257,CongressmanGuthrie,Republican,Constituents in every corner of Kentucky’s Second District rely on wireless communications for their daily lives. I enjoyed talking to former Rep. Chip Pickering today about how we can increase access to spectrum—which is necessary for wireless service—at the Incompas Policy Summit today.
3258,CongressmanClayHiggins,Republican,"We are another step closer toward historic tax relief, and I want to commend my Senate colleagues for delivering this important victory for the American people. This bill is going to conference committee next week, and I’m optimistic that we can put final legislation on President Trump’s desk before the end of the year. We’re going to see tremendous economic growth and new opportunities for all Americans."
3259,RepRoybalAllard,Democrat,"Glad to speak with LA County Sheriff Jim McDonnell at the United States Capitol!  I'm proud to fight alongside my #LACounty congressional colleagues for federal funding to keep LA County safe, and to help lead that fight as the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee."
3260,RepMikeGallagher,Republican,"New op-ed→ By working together to build a viable community that achieves clean water and sustains a healthy Lake Michigan, my hope is that future generations will feel as lucky as we do to call Northeast Wisconsin home."
3261,RepRoKhanna,Democrat,Democrats have a different vision for growing our economy than Republicans. Here's the honest difference in that approach.
3262,RepDWS,Democrat,"The half-baked tax plan Trump rushed to release today demonstrates that the White House isn’t interested in having a serious discussion about tax reform. Instead, Trump is proposing enormous tax cuts to huge corporations and the wealthiest among us, which will add trillions of dollars to the deficit. It’s a personal cash-grab to the President and his mega-wealthy friends who make up his cabinet.   Meanwhile, at the same time, Donald Trump has insisted on slashing funding for Meals on Wheels, lifesaving medical research, and protections on our clean air and clean water. The President should put the interests of the American people ahead of unnecessary tax breaks for he and his buddies."
3263,RepClaudiaTenney,Republican,"Thank you to Amy Turner, Executive Director of the Mohawk Valley Community Action Agency for taking the time to meet with me in New Hartford this morning."
3264,RepRoKhanna,Democrat,"#CA17, please join my first tele-town hall on Monday, 12/11 at 5pm PT.  You can RSVP at https://khannaforms.house.gov/forms/form/?ID=18. I look forward to taking your questions over the phone from Washington DC."
3265,janschakowsky,Democrat,"As I read through this budget proposal, I wonder – did my Republican colleagues really come to Congress with the intention of taking food assistance, health care coverage, and job training support away from children, seniors, people with disabilities, and veterans? I wonder if Chair Black and other Republicans on the Budget Committee actually believe that their constituents want Congress to give millionaires and corporations more tax breaks while taking away the guarantee of Medicare from the rest of us.  I know why I came to Congress: to provide a better standard of living for our nation’s children, seniors and everyone in between; to improve health care in our country and ensure that children can worry about school and chores, not lunch and dinner; and yes – to demand that millionaires and corporations pay their fair share. The Republican Budget directly opposes those goals. It is cruel and irresponsible. I will fight it every step of the way, starting with tomorrow’s markup in the Budget Committee."
3266,RepJuliaBrownley,Democrat,"We must work to modernize our air traffic control system and ensure our aviation industry is more safe and efficient.  At today’s hearing, I had a chance to ask Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao about the alternative ways we can get there and ways we can move forward."
3267,RepMikeJohnson,Republican,"HARVEY has largely moved through our Congressional District now, and by God's grace, the overall damage is less than many expected.  Here are the latest updates we have for our various areas:  Flash flood watches remain in effect for Desoto, Red River,  Natchitoches, Sabine, Vernon, St. Landry, Allen, Beauregard, and Evangeline until 7 PM tonight. Flood warnings will persist thereafter for at least Allen and Evangeline.   Flood warnings remain in effect for Bayou Anacoco near Rosepine and Bundick Creek in Beauregard. There was no breach on the Vernon Lake Dam as was feared.  In Sabine Parish, officials report everything seems to be okay, however, schools remain closed until Tuesday. FEMA just canceled the flood watch for Sabine.  In Allen Parish, some roads are under water but it is receding. No major flooding has occurred beyond that, and schools are open there are in St. Landry Parish.  In Beauregard Parish, some flooding has occurred on Sabine,  south of Toledo Bend with the flood gates being opened.  The Merryville Shelter currently has 7 people.  Caddo, Bossier, Webster and Bienville Parishes made out pretty well in terms of damage.  Currently one shelter is open in Shreveport with 22 evacuees, and two state-run shelters remain on standby.  No plans are in place for any command mtgs unless state shelters are activated.  The large amounts of rain have created dangerous conditions on the Red River, especially in Natchitoches and Alexandria. We have a conference call at 3 pm today with the Navigation Committee for further info.  Desoto Parish has no major issues. There was a washout at Darby Road, but that is the only one reported. A tree fell on a fire engine in Mansfield, but there were no injuries.  As additional updates come in, we will pass them along.  ********  INITIAL AFTERMATH STATISTICS AS OF LAST NIGHT: So far...  - 30 trillion gallons of water dropped in 5 days - 210,000 Texans have registered with FEMA - FEMA has given out $5 million worth of meals - FEMA has distributed $42 million as an EFT payment -165 people were sheltered in LA, many thousands in TX  Members of Congress from TX and LA delegations will meet jointly in Washington early next week with Appropriations and Budget Committee chairmen to discuss disaster relief packages and necessary emergency appropriations."
3268,RepByrne,Republican,Another important step as we work to capitalize on the aviation industry in Alabama. We must continue to grow and train a skilled workforce to meet the unique needs of the aviation industry.
3269,RepresentativeSteveKnight,Republican,"30 years ago today, the City of Santa Clarita was incorporated. In just three decades, the city has grown to be the thriving community we know today. Happy birthday!"
3270,jefffortenberry,Republican,"American Legion, thank you for your fundraising efforts for #vets while exhibiting a piece of our state's history at the Nebraska Antique Tractor Relay today."
3271,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"Recently I asked my constituents to share their thoughts regarding the start of the Trump administration. I have been outspoken in my opposition to the president’s executive orders on women’s reproductive rights, a border wall estimated to cost $15 to $25 billion, and the immigration restrictions impacting refugees. Likewise, I’ve expressed support when justified – namely, the withdrawal from a 12-country trade deal I believe would hurt the people I represent. When asked, 70% of you indicated that you have serious concerns about the current administration and 20% said that you are positive and hopeful for the future given the president’s leadership. This is a troubling ratio, and one that I believe he must address. Thank you to all of those who participated in this survey and to the thousands who continue to share your comments and ideas with me at events, on social media, through website, and by calling my offices. If you want to get regular updates on my work in Congress and partake in my next survey, please visit: https://louise.house.gov/contact/louise-line-sign-up ."
3272,RepGraceNapolitano,Democrat,"Nearly 60,000 of my constituents have gained health coverage through the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) expansion of Medicaid, our nation's single largest payer of mental health services. Now President Trump and House Republicans want to repeal the ACA in favor of cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while gutting mental health services for low-income families. I strongly oppose this repeal effort and urge my Republican colleagues to work with us to strengthen the ACA, so more Americans have access to lifesaving care. If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255). #EndStigma #ProtectOurCare #ACAWorks Read more here: http://bit.ly/2msnqPn"
3273,RepAmiBera,Democrat,Putting America first means preparing our nation for the storms and extreme weather that are impacting us as a direct result of climate change. Putting America first means continuing our role as a global leader in reducing carbon emissions.   Our work over the last decade to reduce carbon emissions put America first -- and this irresponsible executive order throws into uncertainty how we prepare for and tackle the very real consequences of climate change.   We in Sacramento County know all too well the havoc that the dual risk of flooding and drought have on our communities. We risk throwing away decades of hard work growing the clean energy economy and connecting our nation’s workers to the jobs of the future with this partisan and misguided action.
3274,SenatorSherrodBrown,Democrat,"If we want to give tax cuts to the middle class, let's give tax cuts to the middle class – and this bill doesn't do that."
3275,RepNormaTorres,Democrat,We’re at the halfway point of my “Made in the 35th” manufacturing tour. So far this week I’ve visited 9 manufacturers that produce everything from the mats for MMA fights to aluminum used in the wheels for the Mars curiosity rover. We've also seen a company that uses 3D printing to bring down costs for the US military and a plastics manufacturer that creates the baskets your strawberries come in. Follow along to see our last 2 days and 6 stops of the tour!

3278,congressmanjohndelaney,Democrat,"Jessica Rosenworcel, one of two Democratic commissioners currently on the FCC, also called for the vote to be delayed pending a full investigation. ""The FCC is on course to eliminate net neutrality guided by a record corrupted by hundreds of thousands of filings with stolen identities,"" Rosenworcel said."
3279,RepEspaillat,Democrat,"El sábado, 18 de febrero de 2017, de 1pm a 3pm, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) realizará el foro comunitario ""Salud de Nuestra Nación: De la Seguridad Nacional a la ACA"".   Se trata de un evento informativo para abordar la situación actual, que abarca diversos temas, tales como la ""Cláusula de Emolumentos"", qué es y cómo podría aplicarse al Presidente; la dimisión del general Michael Flynn, ¿qué significa para la comunidad de seguridad nacional?; y la ACA: Derogar o Reemplazar, el estatus de la Ley del Cuidado de Salud Asequible.   Este evento está abierto a la prensa."
3280,301936109927957.0,Democrat,"Rights without the vigorous, steadfast defense of our nation’s top justice official become abstract notions rather than sacred promises. Despite well-rehearsed testimony intended to prove otherwise, Senator Jeff Sessions’ record bears witness to an unwavering belief that civil rights should not extend to women, minorities or the LGBT community.  Entrusting the duties and obligations of our Justice Department to a man who opposes the Voting Rights Act, supports a ban on same-sex marriage and rejected the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act would halt our country’s march towards equality. I urge my Senate colleagues to oppose his confirmation as Attorney General."
3281,grassley,Republican,"“I understand you have never missed a single vote in 23 years,” Liz Calman noted as Senator Grassley joined her on Fox Business “Countdown to the Closing Bell” in between votes on the Senate floor to talk about tax reform. “Eight thousand votes without missing a vote,” Senator Grassley said."
3282,SenatorHassan,Democrat,"President Trump’s executive action imposing a religious test on entry into the United States runs counter to the fundamental values that make America the greatest country on earth. It will also make us less safe. We must always be working to strengthen the vetting process for all entryways into the United States, but discriminating against individuals on the basis of their religion will only harm our national security interests.   It is also disgraceful that these executive actions would turn away the brave men and women who have risked their lives to serve as interpreters for our military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is both our moral obligation and a national security imperative to assist those who have helped us, and I will support efforts by Senators Shaheen and McCain to authorize visas for these interpreters.   I will also work in Congress to override this executive action."
3283,repdonbeyer,Democrat,"The uninsured rate just rose for the first time since the Affordable Care Act took effect. You don't make America great again with sabotage.  I'll have more information soon about how we can help counter this trend and get more people signed up. In the meantime, I'll continue fighting for bipartisan legislation to slow the rise of premiums and stabilize insurance markets."

3286,congressmanpittenger,Republican,"Yesterday morning, I had the privilege of attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony for a brand new solar facility in Hope Mills.

3287,repjimrenacci,Republican,"Meet Amanda Suffecool of Wayland, Ohio. Amanda is the director of REALIZE Firearms Awareness Coalition, a non-profit organization focused on teaching firearms safety. #WorkingWomenWednesday    1.  How long have you held your current position and what drew you into your specific field? I have been a director of REALIZE Firearms Awareness Coalition for about 4 years. Our motto is “everyday folks need guns for everyday reasons.” I am also a manufacturing engineer and quality manager. In my spare time, I enjoy competitive target shooting. I am drawn to the mechanical aspects of both firearms and engineering. I have always been strongest in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) and am grateful that I had mentors and family members who encouraged me to follow an nontraditional path in college and in my career. 2. What has been the most challenging aspect of being a woman in a male dominated field? Growing up as the first girl in a family of boys, I relate well with men. But, I have enjoyed being part of the growing sisterhood of women firearms owners. I like the mutual support we give one another, how we work together toward a common goal. 3. What is the most valuable thing you have learned from your job? Success comes from learning to work with others toward a common goal. Everyone does better when they have a supportive team beside them. Seek out networks of like-minded people in your field or create your own network. 4. Is there any advice you would have for young women who are inspired by your example of leadership? Seek out a mentor, someone you admire, and from whom you can learn. Pick a mission you are passionate about and don't look back. Be fearless and know that sometimes you will have to blaze your own trail."

Today, let us recognize the lawyers and judges who fight for the freedoms we enjoy and for a more accessible justice system.

I cosponsored this bill to streamline the benefits claims process between the Department of Veterans Affairs and constituent advocates--such as our caseworkers in my district offices--who process those claims on behalf of veterans and their families.   Our district is home to more veterans than any other Congressional District in New York State, and I was proud to support this important bill to ensure our heroes get the benefits they deserve.

3316,betoorourketx16,Democrat,"Helping service members transition to civilian life and improving the coordination of care is key to helping veterans in El Paso and across that nation. That is why today I reintroduced two bipartisan bills to help address these challenges.   The first is the Mental Health Care Provider Retention Act, which will provide service members receiving mental health care from the Department of Defense the option of keeping their provider upon their exit from the military.  Too many veterans cannot get in to see a mental health provider. For example the first year we started measuring this, 37%  of veterans surveyed could not get a mental health care appointment at the El Paso VA.    Having an established relationship with a single, trusted mental health care provider ultimately helps our veterans get better. This bill will help ensure that can happen.   The second bill is the Veteran Prescription Continuity Act. This bill will help ensure service members can get the same prescription drugs they are receiving on active duty once they leave the military and get their health care through the VA.  Our military heroes should receive the best medicines regardless of whether they are on active duty or a veteran. Right now there’s no guarantee a patient can be prescribed the same drug by a VA doctor as a DoD doctor unless that medication is for post-traumatic stress or chronic pain.  The Veteran Prescription Continuity Act requires the VA and DoD to work together to ensure a veteran can access the same prescriptions he or she received while on active duty, regardless of the condition being treated.  My thanks to Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina and Congressman Mike Coffman of Colorado for joining me in introducing these common sense bills for our veterans."

3336,repjasonsmith,Republican,"Many people do not realize that Missouri is one of the leading producers of timber products in the United States. I stopped at Reynolds Brothers Lumber where they produce railroad ties and other wood items.   We talked about the importance of reducing regulations and allowing for more timber to be harvested. In the past,  U.S. Forest Service - Mark Twain National Forest only allowed 38 million board feet to be harvested in a year. Since I have been in Congress, we have increased the board feet. This year, we are up to 65 million board feet and next year, we are projected to hit 67 million board feet at Mark Twain - good news for agribusinesses like Reynolds Brothers Lumber and for the health of Mark Twain National Forest."

He was a relentless supporter and voice for Veterans across Central Texas. He was a dedicated member of my Veterans Council, and a well deserving recipient of my Congressional Veterans Commendation award. Today we have lost a giant in the Veterans community. His passing will be felt by many, and leaves a distinct hole in our hearts. Erika and I send our deepest sympathies to his wife Debbie, his family, and all who loved Elijah.

I pray that on this day, Americans unite in memory of the words of the founder of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, who wrote that, ""We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness."""
3350,RepJuliaBrownley,Democrat,"As Hispanic Heritage Month comes to a close, the final post in my series highlighting the contributions of Latinos in Ventura County features Judge Michele M. Castillo.  Judge Castillo is a pioneer in the California judiciary, and became the first Latina to sit on the Ventura County Superior Court in June 2016. For over a decade, she has tirelessly served our community and its people through the justice system. She served as a court commissioner prior to becoming appointed by Governor Brown as a Superior Court Judge, where she oversaw hearings involving domestic violence, civil harassment, workplace violence, transitional housing, custody, and child and spousal support.  Prior to serving on the bench, she was a fierce advocate on behalf of some of the most vulnerable populations, including our veterans and people who are homeless, in her former capacity as a Ventura County Deputy Public Defender. Throughout her career, Judge Castillo has worked on thousands of cases. She has fought to ensure that the values of fairness and justice are upheld, and our legal system and the community she serves are better because of it.  Judge Castillo is a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, and the University of Oxford, where she earned a certificate in international human rights law and the international rights of women."

I'm glad to say the tax bill that passed the House on Thursday keeps the adoption tax credit in place for these families. Adoption is a gift for so many deserving children and the families who welcome them. I am blessed with two incredible grandchildren and nephews that have joined my family through adoption. So many kids in our foster care system need a loving, stable home and I strongly encourage people to consider adoption to enrich their families and bring love and stability to a child in need.

3356,CongressmanPatrickMeehan,Republican,"On the proposed changes to the Obamacare repeal bill: I said in March that the legislation was neither a satisfactory repeal of Obamacare, nor an adequate replacement. It threatens to send premiums skyrocketing for people with pre-existing conditions. It will make coverage more expensive for older Americans as they near retirement. And it threatens essential healthcare benefits like doctor’s office visits, opioid addiction treatment and emergency room care.   The MacArthur amendment does not adequately address the concerns I had with the bill as it stood then, and I will oppose the legislation should it come to the House floor. I’m going to keep working to repeal and replace Obamacare with real reforms that make care more affordable and more accessible to Pennsylvania families."

The delegation visited the U.S. Naval Base at Yokosuka Japan and the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea. We met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean Minister Yun Byung-se as well as parliamentarians from Japan and South Korea. Participants in the discussions included high ranking Japanese and South Korean military officials, scholars and current and former officials from the U.S., China, Japan, and South Korea.

The 1st Infantry Division led the way in France during WWI and also marched through the streets of Paris at the request of the French government on July 4, 1917, to lift the morale of the French citizens while honoring Independence Day."

3364,SenatorTedCruz,Republican,"On this day three years ago, courageous students in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong decided to take a stand against creeping authoritarianism invading their city from Beijing. Led by heroes like Joshua Wong, Alex Chow, and Nathan Law, what began as a small gathering of roughly 100 students grew exponentially to 100,000 men and women peacefully demanding the freedom to choose their elected representatives. In the absence of support, however, this “Umbrella Revolution” was no match for Beijing’s determination to avoid a reprise of Tiananmen Square. Ever since the conclusion of these demonstrations in December 2014, the totalitarian grip of China has tightened on this nominally autonomous region. From kidnapping and torturing booksellers to reinterpreting the Basic Law to barring newly elected representatives favoring independence from assuming office, China’s pernicious control over Hong Kong’s government has gone so far as to affect the imprisonment of Wong, Chow, and Law. We mark this day in remembering these three brave young men and the mission they embody: securing liberty for the people of Hong Kong."
3365,RepresentativeMarcyKaptur,Democrat,"I urge President Donald J. Trump, to take a wide view of infrastructure.

3366,RepLujanGrisham,Democrat,I had another opportunity to highlight the need to hold states like New Mexico accountable to ensure food benefits reach recipients.  State employees falsified SNAP application records so they wouldn’t be penalized for not meeting deadlines.  The result is children and families living in one of the most food insecure states in the nation didn’t get their SNAP benefits. I’m glad that USDA has opened a federal investigation and I will continue working with my colleagues to prevent this from happening again.

3372,SenDanSullivan,Republican,"The Senate today took an important vote on funding the government through September 30. While I continue to believe that the process by which we fund the government is fundamentally flawed, the bill we passed will provide the necessary funding to keep the government open for the remainder of the fiscal year – which gives agencies greater fiscal certainty. After years of cuts to our military – which I have repeatedly fought against – we voted to significantly increase spending on our men and women in the U.S. military to address the growing national security threats throughout the world, while not having to simultaneously increase funding for domestic agencies like the EPA or the IRS.   The bill also funds many agencies and programs vital to our state, including NOAA, the Coast Guard’s Arctic priorities, the Essential Air Service program, infrastructure investments across the state, and community health centers – all of which I’ve been pressing for during my tenure in the U.S. Senate. I’m also pleased that the bill provides more than a billion dollars to address the opioid and heroin epidemic facing our nation – which is an issue I have been very focused on. This is a good start, but we need to do much more to turn the tide."
3373,repbettymccollum,Democrat,"The Republicans' tax bill is so bad that the only way the Trump administration can defend it is with a bizarre and misleading one-page analysis that has been thoroughly debunked by independent analysts. Experts across the political spectrum have called the Trump administration's report an ""embarrassing joke"" and said ""no one should believe this study.""  No matter how much fake math President Donald Trump and the Republicans use, they can't hide the simple fact that their tax scam raises taxes on the middle class and explodes the deficit. We must stop this bad bill."

3377,Repmarkmeadows,Republican,"#Obamacare's Multi-State Plan programs not only are ineffective, but they stifle marketplace competition and blatantly waste federal resources.

Currently, women are paid 80 cents for every dollar that men make and in Missouri it is worse, with women making only 78 cents to that dollar.

One in twelve Oregonians is a veteran, and about one fifth of our vets has a service related disability. That’s a lot of people who need and deserve treatment. While I’m always looking for ways to be fiscally responsible, it disturbs me that the President thinks that doing anything to prevent our veterans from receiving necessary care is in anyone’s best interest. That's why today I introduced a bill to prohibit any hiring freeze from specifically affecting the VA. Limiting availability of care is an absolutely unacceptable way to treat the men and women who have risked life and limb in the service of our country. http://schrader.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=390702"

We must wisely invest our precious defense dollars to keep up with these global threats and assert our military dominance. The best defense strategy is to have a military strong enough not only to defeat our enemies, but to keep them from attacking in the first place.   Now is the time to rebuild our military, invest in new technology, and ensure that our brave troops have the best protection and equipment in the world. I’m pleased the House passed the NDAA and included my amendments to provide for important defense priorities for the nation and the state of Missouri.  Missouri-specific provisions within the NDAA include:  -Acquisition of 22 F-18’s -Additional impact aid assistance for Ft. Leonard Wood and Whiteman area schools -Full funding of the B-21 program -Modernization of the Defense Management System for the B-2 at Whiteman AFB -Funding for Phase 1 of a new hospital facility at Fort Leonard Wood  -Funding support for the Army’s Ammunition Production Plant like the one located at Lake City  The defense authorization bill now moves to the Senate for consideration, and I am confident that we will be able to move this legislation forward in a bipartisan manner."

I stand in solidarity with all those participating in a day of action for workers’ and immigrants’ rights. These individuals are part of a long American tradition of demanding rights through nonviolent protest – from sanitation workers in Mississippi to farm workers in California.   Today’s struggles – from the fight for a $15 minimum wage, to upholding civil rights protections for all workers regardless of identity – are still based on the inherent value and dignity of all Americans. We cannot allow millions of our hardworking fellow Americans to continue to be marginalized by unfair wages or by anti-immigrant hatred.

I am encouraged by President Donald Trump’s commitment to putting patients at the center of our health care system, to reforming the tax code so that families can save more of their hard-earned dollars, and to reining in federal regulations to return power to our local communities. These solutions reflect the ideas that we ran on to provide relief from Obamacare’s broken promises and unleash economic growth nationwide.   Our agenda is bold because Americans demanded change and a better way. The House has already made progress by passing over a dozen jobs bills to stop harmful regulations, and the wheels are in motion to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a  plan that gives people more affordable choices and increased access to the care they need. As the health subcommittee chairman, I hope Democrats join us in this effort because as the President said, Obamacare is collapsing. We must move forward with reforms that protect our constituents from a failing system.  President Trump’s speech tonight was inspirational and it struck the right tone. America’s future is bright, and we want to empower people who make it so.

He has ordered a review of all Antiquities Act National Monuments created in the past 20 years. Read my press release here:   Washington, DC –Wednesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata expressed her pleasure to be invited to President Trump’s executive order signing that would review the Antiquities Act.  Due to the importance the order has for American Samoa, Amata was in attendance for the historic signing.  “I want to thank the President for his actions today.  While well intended when first signed into law, the Antiquities Act had become a tool for previous administrations to control nonfederal lands and marine resources without input from the local populations,” said Amata.  “These monument designations that have come at the behest of special interest groups, have often been extremely harmful to those who have traditionally utilized them, such as American Samoa.  Among the monuments being considered are marine monuments in the Pacific, including the monument around American Samoa. If legislative action is necessary, I will take whatever action necessary to return our waters which have sustained us long before our relationship with America. Our people have been cut off from access to regions of the Pacific that we have fished for over a millennium.  I look forward to the corresponding actions that will come as a result of this review, and getting our fishermen back on the waters that have sustained us long before any relationship with the United States.” continued Amata.  The review will specifically examine the designations made over the past 20 years, and will seek to rectify the lack of input from local leadership that has plagued the Act for far too long.  Further actions are expected as a result of the review.  “I want to once again thank President Trump for his keen insight in examining this issue that is so important to American Samoa, and I look forward to continuing to work with his administration and correct this long standing issue that has caused so much harm.  I also want to thank Chairman Bishop for joining me on a letter that we sent to the President earlier this year regarding the issue,” concluded The Congresswoman."

3528,RepStevePearce,Republican,"During the last months of the Obama Administration, a rule was created forcing taxpayer dollars to fund abortion service providers like Planned Parenthood. This completely undermines the rights of states and the fundamental liberties of taxpayers, and in turn, limits women’s access to health clinics around New Mexico.   Yesterday, I voted to overturn this rule so more funds can be allocated to the 165 health clinics across our state that provide important women’s health service, rather than 6 Planned Parenthood facilities in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Farmington, and Rio Rancho.  http://pearce.house.gov/press-release/pearce-votes-return-power-states"

John Lewis of Georgia, spend not one, but TWO, days imparting wisdom to 5000 Role Models of Excellence students. The day after he delivered a rousing speech at our annual Martin Luther King scholarship breakfast, Congressman Lewis addressed students at iTech @ Thomas A. Edison Educational Center.  The boys were treated to intimate stories, such as how the civil rights hero wept at President Obama’s inauguration eight years ago, shedding tears for all of the people who gave their lives so that one day an African-American could be elected to the highest office of the land and others who because of age did not live long enough to see it happen. He also shared war stories from his days as a freedom fighter during the civil rights movement, notably the Bloody Sunday March from Montgomery to Selma, Alabama, and invaluable advice.  On the day that the world celebrates the life and legacy of Dr. King, eight people were wounded in a Miami park that bears his name.  ""Stay away from the violence,"" Lewis urged. ""We've lost too many of our young men.""  He reminded them of the importance standing up for what they believe is right and to live their lives with honor.  “As young men, you have an obligation, a mission, and a mandate,” he said. “You have a legacy to uphold.”  Amen."

Because HealthCare.Gov plan prices are tied to family income, more than half of potential Granite State enrollees will be able to find a 2018 plan for $75 or less per month. This year it’s more important than ever to shop around, because rising premiums will cause some consumers to become newly eligible for the HealthCare.Gov subsidy that helps make coverage affordable, and also because federal health care instability has caused many insurance companies to modify last year’s pricing and provider networks.   Evaluating insurance options can be confusing, but trained professionals listed at localhelp.healthcare.gov are ready to help New Hampshire families navigate this year’s options.   Last but not least, people in New Hampshire need to know that the Trump Administration has moved up the Open Enrollment deadline to December 15th.

3612,SenatorDavidPerdue,Republican,"Today President Trump chose former Atlanta federal prosecutor, Christopher Wray, to lead our nation’s highest law enforcement agency. Mr. Wray has proven he is dedicated to upholding our nation’s laws and seeking justice. His work with DOJ on major cases like the Enron scandal and September 11th terrorist attacks make him an ideal candidate for this very important job."
3613,replizcheney,Republican,"It was great to be in Casper last week. I had the chance to sit down with Aaron Groff at KTWO to discuss getting to work on behalf of the people of Wyoming.

3614,repschrader,Democrat,"Today, I got to see firsthand the impact of the Whitewater Fire. The recent rain and snow has reduced the strength of fires, but the crews I met with are still working to prevent additional flare ups. Since it started, the Whitewater Fire Complex has burned over 14,000 acres. Last week I stood on the House Floor to call attention to the need to change how we pay for firefighting to stop depleting the funds for sustainable management. During this particularly difficult fire season, I want to thank all the men and women who have worked in Oregon’s backyard to protect our forests."

Proud to be the first Member of Congress to visit in its 80 years."
3623,RepLoisFrankel,Democrat,"Republicans are attempting to revive the failed #TrumpCare bill, and despite this new attempt, the problems remain the same. It would force families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, kick millions of Americans off their health insurance, gut key protections including those for people with pre-existing conditions, impose an #AgeTax on older Americans, and shorten the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. Democrats know that health care is a right, not a privilege and we will continue to fight for America’s families to have access to affordable care."
3624,SenCoryGardner,Republican,I introduced five public lands bills today with Senator Michael Bennet. Colorado’s public lands are national treasures and I’m proud to work across the aisle to protect our state’s natural beauty. Each of these measures proposes a legislative fix that will have a lasting impact on Colorado and ensure future generations are able to enjoy Colorado’s great outdoors. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance these bills through the legislative process.

3626,RepFrenchHill,Republican,"Last year, I wrote a letter to then-President-elect Donald Trump asking him to create a regulatory relief task force to address the overly burdensome regulations from federal agencies that are hurting economic and job growth. I am pleased that this administration is showing an appetite for eliminating bad regulatory policy and performing cost-benefit analyses for new rules and regulations. We need a task force or commission to help better assess the problem and keep Congress engaged with the administration on the topic of regulatory reform. The SCRUB Act creates the type of task force that can be useful in stopping the debilitating effects bad regulatory policy has on creating a healthier economy."
3627,RepRogerWilliams,Republican,Last night I voted for the REINS Act to require elected Members of Congress to authorize executive branch rulings before they take effect. This is a sure way to restore much needed accountability in Washington where unelected bureaucrats regularly draft regulations without understanding their full effect on hardworking families and job creators.

3634,RepTulsiGabbard,Democrat,"Reps. Tulsi Gabbard, Susan Davis (CA-53), Joe Wilson (SC-02), Brian Mast (FL-18), and Jacky Rosen (NV-03) today introduced bipartisan legislation to improve access to quality healthcare for disabled veterans.   The Fair Access to Insurance for Retired (FAIR) Heroes Act will allow medically retired veterans to choose between Medicare and TRICARE for their healthcare coverage. Current law requires medically retired veterans to purchase Medicare when they become eligible, and if they fail to enroll, they lose access to TRICARE coverage and face Medicare’s late enrollment penalties and restrictions. The FAIR Heroes Act will give medically retired veterans a choice to enroll in either Medicare or TRICARE, allow a one-time opportunity to switch between the programs if their current plan fails to serve their health needs, and authorizes the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide educational opportunities for veterans to make the best healthcare decision for themselves and their families.    “Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country. Many carry both visible and invisible wounds of war long after they lay down their uniform. Their service should never limit their access to quality healthcare and the ability to make their own decisions about their care. Our bipartisan legislation cuts through the bureaucratic red tape for nearly 30,000 medically retired veterans with disabilities, empowering them to make informed choices on their coverage, while removing penalties and roadblocks to quality healthcare.” - TG"

3636,SenBlumenthal,Democrat,"After reviewing Senator Sessions’ record and reflecting on his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot support his nomination to be Attorney General of the United States. At his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions said simply that he would follow the law. But the Attorney General of the United States must be more than a follower. He must be a leader committed to fighting for civil rights and liberties and the active pursuit of justice.  Senator Sessions has failed to convince me that he will be a champion of constitutional rights: voting rights, women’s health care and privacy rights, and anti-discrimination protections. Rather, he has demonstrated hostility and antipathy – even downright opposition – to these bedrock Constitutional principles. He has prided himself on his vociferous opposition to comprehensive immigration reform – legislation that passed the Senate with 68 bipartisan votes. He staunchly opposed a criminal justice reform bill that has attracted a group of 25 cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans. He even split with the majority of his own party to vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Indeed, his career demonstrates a prevailing hostility to the very rights and liberties that the nation’s chief law enforcement officer must always promote and defend. Equally important, I have no confidence he will be the independent, non-political enforcer the nation needs – at a moment when the incoming Administration faces ethical and legal controversies that are unprecedented in scope and scale in our history."

3638,RepDrewFerguson,Republican,I was excited to join my colleagues last week to highlight the importance of rural America. Check out some of the highlights below.
3639,CongressmanEricSwalwell,Democrat,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions must go, but not because of his troubled relationship with President Trump - it's because he has had a loose relationship with truth.   I told MSNBC's All In with Chris Hayes that if Sessions goes, the Senate must ensure that his successor is a true law enforcement official who played no role in the President's campaign and will deal with the Russia situation fairly. Chris Hayes and I also discussed Jared Kushner's appearance tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee."
3640,repraskin,Democrat,"Today we remember the thousands who perished in the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, a day that is seared in our memories. Let us honor those we lost and the heroism of those first responders and brave people who risked their lives to save others. We are forever grateful for the courage and bravery of police officers, firefighters, military personnel, rescue workers, nurses and doctors, and good Samaritans who rushed into the emergency sites to rescue and aid their fellow Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the victims, the injured, and the fallen heroes. We rededicate ourselves to defend pluralistic liberal democracy and the struggle to defeat terrorism and totalitarian fanatics of all ideological stripes."
3641,SenatorKaine,Democrat,"President Trump's proposed budget would harm rural communities. If he eliminates programs like the Community Development Block Grants and the National Endowment for the Arts, we would undo the progress of revitalizing neighborhoods and growing local economies. Hardworking people and businesses in Lynchburg can't afford senseless cuts like this, and I promised Mayor Foster and community leaders I'll stand strong against this budget proposal."

3649,CongressmanGarretGraves,Republican,"Today's historic vote to modernize our tax code will help hardworking Louisianans keep more of their paychecks. The bill also strips loopholes, bailouts and handouts while improving the global competitiveness of U.S. small businesses and employers. This will improve the health of the economy, increase wages and create more employment opportunities in Louisiana and other states. All income brackets are reduced by the legislation and the standard deduction is nearly doubled. To put this in perspective, the average American family of four making $55,000 will pay no taxes.  This is a huge win and I look forward to working together to continue to address priorities and help to perfect the bill through the legislative process. Specifically, we need to ensure students and retirees are treated fairly and that the value of a reformed historic and new market credit program is considered.   After 31 years, we are finally on track to have fair, simple and lower taxes."

3661,RepSmucker,Republican,"I wish to address the letter (""Stonewalling from Smucker's office"") that appeared in Wednesday’s LNP + LancasterOnline.com. Prior to this letter being printed, a meeting with the letter writer and her husband was confirmed and put on my schedule, as I try to do with as many requests as possible.  I reviewed the letter writer's correspondence with my office. At no time did my scheduler “stonewall” her and say I would not meet with her. No one in my office either said or implied “too bad, no appointments.”  While hiring staff for my Lancaster and Washington offices, I placed great importance on professionalism and respect. I consistently reiterate to my staff to act with civility. My office receives dozens of meeting requests each day, and works to accommodate them as quickly as possible. Finally, I categorically reject any assertion that meetings are prioritized based on campaign contributions.  That said, in my brief time in Congress, several reports about my actions have been riddled with errors.  LNP regularly offers commentary on how public officials should do our jobs and positions or actions we should take. That’s LNP’s right and its responsibility to its readers. In the spirit of open dialogue, I suggest that in order to preserve journalistic integrity (on the ropes as of late) and to remain an accurate and objective arbiter of facts, LNP should actually confirm information that targets me by name and is presented as fact.  That is hard work. But hard work is a core value in our communities. Responsible journalism requires more. My record of responding to LNP requests for comment and access is nearly 100 percent and often within tight deadlines.  Differences of opinion, debate and engagement are welcome. Unsubstantiated claims and factual errors damage both the notions of a free press and faith in public institutions."
3662,RepAmiBera,Democrat,"We’re closer than ever to agreeing on real, bipartisan solutions to fix the Affordable Care Act, but instead the Senate is once again trying to kick millions off their health care and gut protections for folks with preexisting conditions.

3663,RepBrianBabin,Republican,"I applaud President Trump for finally putting an end to this misguided proposal. Since before I was elected to Congress, I have heard from farmers, business owners and countless others about the massive costs and uncertainty that this rule would have imposed. It is the sort of federal power grab that I came here to stop, and that the American people soundly rejected at the ballot box last November. I am confident that President Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt will put forth a common sense approach to update the Clean Water Act for the challenges and needs of the 21st Century, and I look forward to supporting their efforts here in Congress."

House bill 7069 diverts public tax dollars away from public schools to private corporations. Hillsborough County Schools have significant repair and upgrade needs that are being delayed because the legislature continues to divert monies to for-profit charter corporations that serve far fewer students. These corporations have a great deal of political lobbying power in Tallahassee, so legislators and the governor need to hear from people at home. Legislators also propose to take away reading and guidance resources from students that need help the most. One of the keys to a strong, thriving economy is a good education. By hobbling our children’s education now, these legislators are threatening Florida and our economic future. I urge you to join me and contact Gov. Scott and urge him to veto this harmful bill.

3713,senatortomudall,Democrat,"Our capacity to seize opportunities and face the many challenges ahead rests heavily on our ability to make decisions driven by scientific data. And our state’s economic future depends on ensuring that the next generation has the knowledge and skills – especially in science and math – to qualify for jobs in cutting-edge fields.    That is why Senator Martin Heinrich and I were so disturbed to learn that the New Mexico Public Education Department has proposed watering down science education standards for our public schools by removing any references to rising temperatures, climate change and evolution in our state’s K-12 science education curriculum. If we weaken our science standards to advance an ideological agenda at the expense of scientific facts, we will put New Mexico at a distinct disadvantage.   We urge all New Mexicans to make their voices heard as the Public Education Department seeks public input on their proposed new science standards. There is a better way forward that gives our students all of the knowledge and skills they will need to succeed.

Anyone who went to Iraq or Afghanistan can sign up.   Now, the registry is helping scientists to better understand why veterans are experiencing breathing problems. They’ve noticed a connection between blast exposure and lung injuries. I encourage service members and veterans to keep signing up for the registry. It is critical that the VA continue studying every hazard to the health and well-being of our service members so that we may protect them during service and get them the health care they have earned when they return home.    http://www.npr.org/2017/10/26/560152292/va-examines-link-between-blast-exposure-and-lung-injuries"

Graduates in the STEM fields have the potential to develop technologies that could save lives, jump-start new industries, or even discover new worlds.  Young girls should be empowered at an early age to engage and lead in NASA and in these innovative fields.  Our 21st Century economy calls for a next generation of students who are skilled in the STEM fields and can be leaders in our nation’s innovation economy.  This legislation spurs a number of initiatives at NASA that will provide more resources to young girls and women who aspire to succeed as scientists, engineers, astronauts, mathematicians, and in many other STEM careers.  Recently, a movie was released detailing a few of the unsung heroes of NASA.  This movie, Hidden Figures, highlights the moving story of the group of African-American women who worked at NASA as mathematicians and battled discrimination during the Space Race.  The INSPIRE Women Act will afford opportunities to a future generation of women leaders who will have a similar impact on our nation’s history and maybe, one day, put a woman on Mars."

3750,RepRoybalAllard,Democrat,"The Department of Homeland Security’s termination of #TemporaryProtectedStatus for #Nicaraguans is a cruel and shortsighted decision that will tear families apart, devastate communities, and weaken the U.S. economy.  And the brief reprieve for #Honduran #TPS recipients will only add to their anxiety and uncertainty about their future in America.  TPS recipients work hard to strengthen our industries and our communities.  They love America, and they are an integral part of our country.  Many have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, and they are one of the most heavily vetted communities in our nation.  It makes no sense to subject them to a mass deportation.  And their U.S.-born children will suddenly be torn between their American roots and their loving family.  National security experts support extending TPS.  So does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  So does the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Migration and Refugee Services.  And so do I.  DHS’s differing responses towards Nicaraguan and Honduran TPS recipients in the US are a stark illustration of why we need comprehensive immigration reform to resolve the numerous #immigration issues facing our nation.  I also support immediate congressional passage of Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez’s American Promise Act, which will ensure individuals who have lived in the U.S. under TPS for at least three years can stay in America and pursue a path to #naturalization.  #SaveTPS"
3751,95696782238.0,Democrat,"Since President Donald John Trump’s election, my Congressional offices have received numerous calls and letters expressing concern over his use of Mar-a-lago as an almost weekly retreat. His constant use of his own property is padding his own pockets with taxpayer money, while significantly harming local businesses and straining primary law enforcement agencies to the brink. For instance, over just one holiday alone, the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office was forced to absorb $250,000 in unforeseen expenses.  It is offensive that President Trump insists on a budget that unequivocally, and without mercy, attacks hardworking Americans, and then has the audacity to turn around and insist that our local police officers, first responders and small businesses suffer under his insistence that he be allowed to enjoy a lavish life style at taxpayer expense.  That is why I introduced the TRUMPED Act. The bill is based on a simple premise: if President Trump wants to make continual use of his properties, then he may do so, but he can't have taxpayers foot the bill."

It is essential that the federal government provide adequate resources to match the urgency and severity of this crisis in the hardest-hit states like New Hampshire. Currently, the funding formula used to allocate funding from the 21st Century Cures Act is flawed. We must distribute funding to states that need it the most, based on factors like per capita death rates instead of just favoring the biggest states.   Today, along with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Joe Manchin III, and Senator Shelley Moore Capito I introduced the bipartisan Targeted Opioid Formula Act to change the funding formula so states most impacted by the opioid epidemic can get the resources they need."

After serving Thanksgiving dinner to some who had no place to go, she opened a warehouse in Wyandotte that provides furniture, clothing, food, wheelchairs etc., and volunteers to help find housing, take veterans to the doctor or provide other things people need. I have attended many veteran events that have mattered, but this dinner was one of the most special as people just came together to thank the men and women who served and remind ourselves of the moral obligation we have to those who have sacrificed to keep us free.  This weekend also brought the Taylor Summer Festival 2017,  Trenton Summer Festival, Wayne County Senior Picnic, Ann Arbor Police and Fire Department Open House, Jim Toy Summer Festival, UAW party celebrating Joe Goddard’s retirement, graduations, farmers markets and many other events.   Everywhere I went, people are worried about health care. The proposal Senate Republicans released last week has many very frightened. I agree with President Trump on one thing on health care - the House bill was mean and from my perspective, the Senate bill could be even meaner. It undermines protections for those with pre-existing conditions and would have a devastating impact on working families with tens of millions of Americans losing coverage, and millions more paying more for less care. This legislation literally means life or death for people in Michigan and across the country. I will do everything possible to defeat this bill that will hurt millions of Americans. And yes I will work to improve the Affordable Care Act – it's not perfect as I have said many times. But hurting our most vulnerable, children, seniors, those with preexisting conditions, and the middle aged with increased costs is not the answer. D2"

This cowardly act of hanging bananas from nooses across the American University campus, with the messages “AKA Free” and “Harambe Bait,” is not only despicable, but is also a hate crime for which the person or people responsible should be appropriately charged.  I strongly urge the university to take every step necessary to uncover those responsible for this crime and ensure that they get a well-deserved day in court.   It is a travesty that in this day and age, such bigotry still exists.   No matter how high we go—whether it’s being elected the nation’s first black president or AU’s first African-American student government president—some people just can’t help themselves from going low.  Unfortunately, this is not even the first time in the past year that such a controversy has occurred on AU’s campus.   Without the appropriate action, it will not be the last.   Sadder still, American University is not the only campus on which white students are expressing their prejudices against students of color.    I stand here today with my sorors to let the world know that we will not stand silent in the face of racism.

The program, named Operation Blue Roof, provides a temporary covering of blue plastic sheeting to help reduce further damage to property until permanent repairs can be made. The blue plastic sheeting is installed using strips of wood that are secured to the roof with nails or screws.  Only primary residences that have standard shingled roofs are eligible to receive a temporary blue roof. Metal roofs and mobile homes will be repaired as practical on a case by case basis, and roofs with greater than 50 percent structural damage are not eligible for this program.  This program is available at no cost to eligible primary homeowners in Charlotte, Collier, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Pinellas, and Sarasota, counties. Renters must obtain legal permission to continue occupying the residence until more permanent repairs are made.  Homeowners must sign a Right of Entry (ROE) form to allow government employees and contractors onto their property to assess damage and install the temporary covering. ROE collection centers will be set up by Corps teams in convenient neighborhood locations. Updated information about collection center locations in each county will be distributed daily.

3843,RepSanfordSC,Republican,"Tuesday evening, the House passed S.J. Res. 34, a bill that would repeal a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule requiring internet service providers to get your explicit permission before using and sharing your confidential information. This includes things ranging from Social Security numbers to information on your children. The bill passed by a vote of 215 to 205. I was one of 15 Republicans to vote against the bill and would like to explain why I thought it was important to do so.  Each one of the rights enshrined in the Constitution are fragile. Without active and constant defense, seemingly unimportant things chip away at what the Founding Fathers set up in freedom being the hallmark of the American experiment. This was a vote about pushing back at one of those seemingly innocuous things creeping in and taking from us a building block of freedom.  The Fourth Amendment ensures: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”  And that’s what this vote came down to.  Should you - or should the company through which you get internet service - be the decision maker in determining whether your information can be sold? Are you given the direct choice to waive the right of determining this or are you not?  With this vote, I said it should be you.   The FCC rule simply applies this notion to your online privacy by putting the decision over the use of confidential information back in the the hands of the customer. So, when the government blocks a rule intended to solidify this fundamental cornerstone, as it did yesterday, it effectively chips away at it.   On this theme, civil liberty is a fundamental part of liberty. In the age of terrorism and the internet, it tends to be a component of liberty that people focus less on…but we do this at our own peril. The Founding Fathers actually took the time to enumerate this right. They saw it as just as important as the right to free speech or the right to bear arms...and accordingly, I think we should too. Because where one right is corroded, I would argue it becomes easier to weaken others.   It's for this reason that in just the past couple years I voted for and co-sponsored the Email Privacy Act twice. I voted against the USA Freedom Act multiple times because it didn’t go far enough to reign in bulk data collection under the Patriot Act. And, this January, I introduced the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act to strip the REAL ID law of its privacy-compromising provisions.   I was disappointed when I learned that the House would be voting on the bill to block the FCC’s rule, and some even tried to portray it as a jurisdictional issue between the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. But this issue at the core had much bigger implications, which is why I voted as I did."

3846,UsRepRickNolan,Democrat,"Republican leaders are promising to show us their so-called “tax reform” bill next week.   So to be clear, any tax reform bill must answer these THREE KEY QUESTIONS with a “YES” before I’ll support it.    1)  “Does it benefit middle class working families?” This is always my #1 priority. Our hardworking families deserve a tax plan that works for them – one that allows them to buy homes, get their kids through college, take vacations and save for retirement.   2)  “Does it ensure that Wall Street millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share?” In a country with continual income inequality, where the economic system is already rigged for the rich, real tax reform requires those at the top are paying their fair share. We can’t ask working families to pay more while cutting taxes for the rich.  3) “Does it incentivize multi-national corporations to create good paying jobs here in America?” Our American workers can’t afford a tax plan that incentivizes big corporations to ship their good paying jobs overseas. Real tax reform helps grow our economy here at home, reinvests in our people, and creates more good paying jobs.     The fact is, we can create millions of good paying jobs by restoring a fair distribution of wealth.

3848,repscottperry,Republican,"ICYMI: I was proud to support H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, which passed the House this week. The bill removes access/time limits on GI Bill education benefits, which will help more Veterans. Previously, Veterans had 15 years from the end of their service to use this benefit; now there’s no expiration. The bill also extended full GI Bill benefits to all Post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients, regardless of length of service. This bill ensures that our Veterans may use the benefits they’ve earned.

3851,Rep.Grijalva,Democrat,"Great article from yesterday detailing the devastating effects of myalgic encephalomyelitis, commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. This debilitating condition that can leave patients with lower quality of life scores than lung cancer patients, affects an estimated 1 to 2.5 million individuals nationwide, including an estimated 5,000 persons right here in Arizona's Third Congressional District.   Unfortunately, we will not know more about this disease - how to properly diagnose it or effective treatments - until funds are allocated at the federal level for further research. ME/CFS patients have been ignored for long enough - it's time to fully commit ourselves to ensuring that these patients are able to live the lives they deserve."
3852,RepSewell,Democrat,"I want to take a moment to thank all those who wrote me about what the Affordable Care Act means for them, who joined me at community meetings, and shared stories about the strengths and weaknesses of our healthcare system.

It's people like Debra who remind me what matters most in our healthcare system and that both parties need to come together to make healthcare coverage more affordable for all Americans.

3854,repdonbeyer,Democrat,"Last night Donald J. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The reasons he gave for this made no sense, and the obvious conclusion is that this was an attempt to undermine the Trump-Russia investigation.   So what am I going to do? I'm going to fight for a special prosecutor. I'm going to keep pushing to get Trump's tax returns. And I'm going to be urging Congress to do our jobs and hold the Trump Administration accountable."

NIH funding is critical to medical innovation, science, and patient care--any cuts to NIH will be a disservice to our communities who rely on Penn Medicine for the cutting-edge life saving treatments they provide.    President Trump's proposal to cut NIH by $6 Billion dollars will have a devastating lasting impact on our medical students, hospitals and current and future patients.   I reassured the doctors I spoke with that I will do everything I can to make sure NIH is properly funded because communities nationwide depend on it!

The EPA gave notice yesterday to dozens of EPA advisory board scientists that they would not receive a second three-year term on a board after their current term expires. This means that come August, 38 of the 49 remaining board subcommittee members--who conduct independent review of research performed by the EPA--will not be renewed. It is yet another sign that the Trump Administration is moving forward with its plan to replace scientists with industry- and business-related appointees.

3951,petesessions,Republican,This morning I was honored to receive the True Blue award from the Family Research Council for my 100% rating for my unwavering commitment to supporting religious freedom and pro-life measures.
3952,SenatorPatrickLeahy,Democrat,"In an address to the Senate today on the Senate Floor I reported on President Trump’s budget.  This unbalanced budget does not support working families or lift up the most vulnerable among us so that they can get on their feet.  We should not be recklessly slashing vital lifelines that help Americans with basic needs so they can lift themselves and their families onto paths of opportunity.  This budget particularly targets Rural America, in states like Vermont.  It would *literally* leave Vermonters in the cold by completely eliminating LIHEAP.  It would slash Medicaid funds that Vermont relies on to keep rural hospitals open.  It would force millions of children near poverty off health insurance.  All of this to fund a wall that doesn’t work and further benefit the very wealthiest in our society.  The power of the purse rests with Congress.  I pledge to work with Chairman Cochran to work toward the goal of passing all twelve appropriations bills, in an open, bipartisan process, that more accurately reflect the true values and needs of our nation."
3953,repjoecrowley,Democrat,"I am deeply concerned by reports that the Department of Homeland Security has detained and potentially begun deportation proceedings for Carlos Humberto Cardona, a constituent of mine who served our country as a Ground Zero cleanup worker in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Mr. Cardona is now facing respiratory and other serious health issues as a result of his efforts at the World Trade Center site.   Deporting Mr. Cardona would send a chilling message not just to the #immigrants who call our country home, but to all who would help when their country calls on them. This is not what the United States represents.    Read my letter to DHS Secretary John Kelly strongly urging him to reconsider these actions: https://go.usa.gov/xNwYc"
3954,senatorhirono,Democrat,"Today, I voted against the nomination of Mike Pompeo to serve as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Representative Pompeo has been wrong on many critical intelligence issues during his 6 years in Congress.   He won’t disavow his past support of torture. He opposed the release of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s torture report. He has advocated for reinstating mass surveillance of American citizens. He recently left the door open to outsourcing surveillance of American citizens to foreign governments to circumvent existing laws. He opposes the closure of Guantanamo. He opposes the Iran nuclear agreement.  Congressman Pompeo is the wrong person to the lead the Central Intelligence Agency."
3955,RepKarenBass,Democrat,The idea we'd spend on a wall that's not needed or wanted is ridiculous. Fasten your seatbelts. #inners

3959,mcmorrisrodgers,Republican,"The Northwest Justice Project is Washington state’s publicly funded civil legal aid program, with three locations in Eastern Washington: Walla Walla, Spokane, and Colville. They do incredible work on behalf of those who need legal help. I was honored and excited to meet with the NJP’s Spokane office today, and to learn more about the great work they’re doing--for example, in 2016 alone, they provided aid to almost 30,000 people, including 13,200 children and 1,290 veterans."
3960,RepDWS,Democrat,"I was proud to host my annual Small Business Workshop yesterday to connect our government agencies and business experts with the people and businesses that are driving our South Florida economy forward.

It's essential because small businesses are the cornerstone of our South Florida economy."

3963,SenatorWhitehouse,Democrat,"Rolling back protections for transgender students is cruel and unnecessary. Rhode Island was founded on the notion of tolerance. We were so concerned with it, we waited to join the union until we were sure everyone's rights would be protected. As Rhode Islanders have told me again and again, discrimination is contrary to who we are.  Thank you to Rhode Island's schools who are standing firm."
3964,RepFrenchHill,Republican,"NCAA March Madness will officially be underway tonight when Mount St. Mary's and New Orleans tip off for the first of the four play-in games. While we love basketball’s madness on the court, the sport can also help to eliminate madness off the court. High school and college sports have historically played a great role in teaching kids the leadership skills and giving them the guidance needed to be successful in life.     Legendary high school basketball coach Bob Hurley has been doing this for decades. Take a moment to watch this inspirational story from Jersey City, NJ, about Hurley’s career at St.Anthony's High School, where he has a reputation for making his students winners in school, on the court, and in life.    As a practical guy with a background in business, I look at all public policy challenges through the prism of ""what works."" My Community Empowerment Initiative (CEI) is based on highlighting the exceptional work by local people in towns who are successfully tackling some of society's biggest issues. Bob Hurley and high school basketball coaches around the country are responsible for producing so many of the college athletes we love to watch create madness on the court, but more importantly these coaches are doing their part to reduce madness off the court for some of the America’s most vulnerable youth.   Enjoy this year's tournament, and of course, Go Hogs!"
3965,SenGaryPeters,Democrat,"I had a great time Tuesday visiting one of my alma maters University of Detroit Mercy. I had the opportunity to meet with University President Dr. Antoine Garibaldi as well as the Dean of the School of Business, Dr. Joseph Eisenhauer. As a UDM Business School graduate, it was great to hear about their innovative programs centered around entrepreneurship and business development."
3966,RepJuanVargas,Democrat,"Proud to join my colleagues in the effort to ensure that Puerto Rico receives the federal assistance it needs during this time of crisis. More than 3.5 million Americans are in dire need of water, medicine, and supplies. We have to honor our responsibility to help our fellow Americans—Congress must act quickly to help Puerto Rico."
3967,RepCharlieCrist,Democrat,It's so encouraging to see young people like Oliver who are standing up to make sure that our country continues to be a beacon of hope for people around the world. Honored to have him join me for the Presidential Address Tuesday to bring attention to his truly remarkable efforts!
3968,RepColleenHanabusa,Democrat,"President Trump's lack of leadership on core American values is indefensible.    “How long has it taken for this country to come to the point where they realize that the KKK did not represent that which is America. And now, this president is basically opening the door to that again,” said Hawaii Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa."

3983,BlaineLuetkemeyer,Republican,"Today represents a major victory for Main Street America and Americans who simply want the opportunity to achieve financial independence.   Passage of the Financial CHOICE Act will end the era of taxpayer-funded bailouts for Wall Street and give Main Street access to the financial tools it needs to succeed. The Financial CHOICE Act delivers much needed regulatory relief, and I am proud of my colleagues in the House of Representatives who recognize the importance of this comprehensive, jobs first, bill."

3991,RepPatTiberi,Republican,"For years we warned President Obama that his executive actions hurt Ohio’s coal industry, raised prices and limited our nation’s energy potential. President Donald J. Trump's announcement today to reverse the harmful power-plant rules will go a long way to lift the economic hardships the Obama administration forced on Ohio families, job creators and coal workers. As we work to rein in the EPA, it is my hope that this agency can take a more balanced and commonsense approach to protect the environment without putting unnecessary burdens on the backs of hardworking, middle-class Americans."
3992,RepLujanGrisham,Democrat,"It is inexcusable that New Mexico has the highest per capita rape kit backlog in the country, given that in New  Mexico one in four women and one in twenty men have experienced sexual assault in their lifetime.  Completing a rape kit and ensuring that it is processed in a timely manner is critical in many sexual assault cases. The NM Congressional Delegation has successfully pushed for more federal funding to address this issue in the state, but much more needs to be done to reduce the backlog and bring criminals to justice."
3993,RepRatcliffe,Republican,"This Police Week, I'm proud that the U.S. House is passing key legislation in support of law enforcement, including my bill, H.R. 1616, which authorizes a premier police training center located in my colleague, Congressman Gary Palmer's district in Hoover, Alabama.  The National Computer Forensics Institute has trained more than 6,250 law enforcement officers from all across the country, including folks in Texas' 4th District. We are happy to play a role in its continued success. Our men and women in blue deserve nothing less."
3994,aumuaamata,Republican,"Talofa! Yesterday we held an Oversight and Investigations hearing on the Endangered Species Act! Read my press release here:  Washington, D.C. –Tuesday, at a hearing of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Congresswoman Aumua Amata called for more local input into federal environmental decision-making.  “American Samoa is the jewel of the U.S. in the Pacific,” began Amata. “We have many exciting species that are only found in the archipelago. However, just because they are only found in American Samoa does not mean that they are endangered. The local communities in both the territories and the Native American tribes should be consulted, and given a voice before the Fish and Wildlife Service adds or removes an animal from the endangered species list, so that it does adversely affect the economic or infrastructure development of the United States’ poorest areas.”  Amata asked the panel of witnesses whether the United States had an obligation to consult with either territorial leaders, or tribal leaders when their people would be affected. The hippie said they’ll always support animals over people. The panel, generally agreed that the Endangered Species Act is sometimes at odds with the duties and responsibilities of the United States over the territories and Native American tribes.  Chairman Labrador had the following to say “the testimony we heard today is crystal clear that we need – in an infrastructure package or legislation moving forward – to address ESA for people and species. This law is a lawyer’s dream that has the power to block projects entirely while taxpayers foot the bill.”"
3995,DianaDeGette,Democrat,"Everyone deserves safe drinking water – but that’s far from guaranteed in this country, as the ongoing crisis in #Flint has shown. We can do better by passing the Safe Drinking Water Amendments Act (H.R. 1068), which I am co-sponsoring. At a hearing today on our nation's water delivery systems, I questioned experts on the subject, who agreed that these changes would ensure that every American can trust what comes out of the tap."
3996,SenatorBlunt,Republican,"Beginning July 1, college students will once again be eligible for year-round Pell Grants.

4005,8037068318.0,Democrat,"Let’s make no mistake, the House emergency supplemental appropriations bill for disaster relief is just the start of Federal financial support for Puerto Rico. Much more needs to be done, but, for now the bill includes critical measures that the Island needs in the short term to respond to this once-in-a-generation humanitarian crisis. Importantly, in addition to funding emergency assistance from FEMA, the legislation helps address pressing liquidity needs of the Puerto Rican government by providing them with loans to meet a looming cash shortfall.  In doing so it is critical that Wall Street creditors are unable to access these federal funds, which are solely intended to help Puerto Ricans begin to rebuild their lives.   Going forward, Puerto Rico faces a long path to full recovery and we cannot rest until the Island is made whole. I fully expect Congress to provide additional assistance, including rebuilding the energy grid, repairing telecommunications networks and mending the infrastructure system. We must also ensure a long term fix for Puerto Rico’s long ailing Medicaid system, something that was a critical priority before Maria, but is even more important now.     I thank Leader Pelosi, Ranking Member Lowey and the House Leadership for their work on this initial package. I look forward to working with my colleagues in coming weeks to address Puerto Rico’s longer term needs"

Every single one of them is excelling. They are part of our future. Ending DACA will cost Delaware’s GDP $88 million and a loss of nearly 460 billion for our country. America thrives on diversity. We have a moral obligation to stand up for these young Americans. I will continue to join my colleagues in fighting to reinstate DACA."

Knowing the history of his confirmation is important. Knowing the arguments used by other Senators to try to keep Senator Revels out of DC is important. Until the passage of the 14th Amendment, they claimed Sen. Revels was not a U.S. citizen. Now, exactly 147 years after Senator Revels was sworn in, do we see the truth? Hiram Rhodes Revels was black and they did not want him in the Senate because he was black. Implicit accusations are still abundant.

4013,repfrankpallone,Democrat,"Today Senator Menendez and I traveled today to Union Beach—a community on Raritan Bay devastated by Superstorm Sandy—to lay out proposed sweeping reforms to address the waste, abuse and mismanagement plaguing the system that led to delayed recovery for Sandy survivors.    Superstorm Sandy devastated many communities in my district. In the wake of the storm, too many of my constituents found that, after responsibly paying for their flood insurance, their policy failed to provide the coverage they needed and deserved when they needed it the most. Many were prevented from repairing their homes and resuming their lives by a claims review process that moved too slowly and was riddled with fraud. As this was happening and people were suffering, the flood insurance companies made record profits.The SAFE NFIP Act takes concrete steps to make the program more affordable, increase oversight and transparency of the flood insurance companies, invest in mitigation efforts, and reform the claims process using lessons learned from Sandy. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fight for this bill and our constituents."

While he described the move as “temporary,” his behavior has compromised the effectiveness of the Committee and I believe made it almost impossible for the panel to investigate any connections to Russia. While I am hopeful this move by Rep. Nunes offers the opportunity to get the House investigation back on a bipartisan track, I still feel that the American people would be better served—the truth would be better served—by the creation of an independent commission to investigate these attacks on our democratic processes."

It is imperative that we have an independent government ethics office shielded from political whims that will keep our government transparent and free of conflicts of interest.   While the President and certain House Republican leaders have disparaged this independent agency and challenged its crucial work, I am thankful that my colleagues on the Committee agree that it is the responsibility of the Judiciary Committee to ensure that OGE can operate without fear of political attacks."

4041,RepAndyBiggs,Republican,"Today is the end of Small Business Week, and I commend the thousands of men and women in my district who are small business owners. Small businesses create 63% of new jobs in this country, and almost 50% of private sector employees work for a small business.   Owning your own business is not easy. It takes courage, foresight, wisdom, capital, and years of perseverance. Lots of small businesses don’t work out, but that doesn’t make the efforts any less valuable. Every lesson learned and applied helps the American economy prosper.   President Donald J. Trump and this Congress are committed to helping small businesses succeed. So far, we have cut regulations that will save billions of dollars in compliance fees, and will be considering a tax reform package to lower the tax rate for businesses. Our work is making it easier for small businesses to operate, which, in turn, opens the door for significant job creation.   I applaud the small business owners in Arizona’s Fifth Congressional Districtand around the country, and thank them for the endless positive contributions they make to our economy."

4047,SenatorTedCruz,Republican,"Yesterday's decision to strike down Texas's commonsense Voter ID law undermines the rule of law and frustrates Texas’s responsibility to preserve the integrity of its elections. As the Supreme Court explained in Crawford v Marion County, ‘flagrant examples of [voter] fraud . . . have been documented throughout this Nation’s history by respected historians and journalists [and] demonstrate that not only is the risk of voter fraud real but that it could affect the outcome of a close election.’ Voter fraud diminishes confidence in our democratic process, and minority voters are far too frequently the victims of that fraud. The Voter ID law is a commonsense protection to safeguard the rights of every Texan and to prevent illegal voter fraud. The district judge's opinion to the contrary violates Supreme Court precedent, and I trust that the Fifth Circuit will reverse it on appeal. http://bit.ly/2w1TAYy"

4049,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton just announced that he is appealing the unanimous finding of a three-judge court in San Antonio that the State’s congressional redistricting map intentionally discriminated and violated the Constitution. He is also seeking to block the San Antonio court from taking any action to remedy this unconstitutional discrimination. These desperate, highly questionable Paxton-Abbott maneuvers come after yet another ruling against the State of Texas for intentional discrimination decision by a three-judge federal court that includes two Republican appointees. I believe that this Paxton-Abbott scheming only reaffirms the position that I have consistently taken. While the three-judge decision about some Republican redistricting wrongs is legally correct, nothing will be finally resolved until the Supreme Court has its say. I am seeking reelection in the district that I represent today from south San Antonio to north Austin, without the change of a single voter, until such time as the Supreme Court issues a final order telling me otherwise."

Now, as president, he can’t help but spread new lies about President Obama in order to distract the public from the ever-growing revelations regarding ties between his associates and the Russian government.   Donald Trump’s ridiculous wiretapping tweets came just one day after it was uncovered that his senior aide Jared Kushner and his ousted adviser Michael Flynn had an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In response to the continuing controversy around his relationship with Russia, Trump has attacked President Obama, the intelligence community and journalists. And congressional Republicans are not much better—they are more interested in beating up on the press and whistle-blowers than getting to the bottom of Russian interference in the 2016 election.  I call on Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican Conference to listen to Director Comey’s testimony and demand that Trump retract his false claims about wiretapping"

4074,CongressmanJimHimes,Democrat,"The budget passed today sets the table for a multi-trillion dollar explosion in our national debt. True, comprehensive tax reform that helps the middle class and simplifies the tax code to help American businesses compete globally and hire more American workers is desperately needed. However, we should not greatly increase our deficits and debt for irresponsible tax cuts just because legislators are desperate to pass a bill. We have continued to call for a bipartisan, long-term, balanced approach that demonstrates fiscal responsibility, but this misses the mark.   No one can claim surprise, because we’ve lived for years with this blatant hypocrisy. When it comes to unchecked military spending, tax cuts for the wealthy or subsidies for narrow industry interests, there’s always money to be found or, more accurately, borrowed. But when it’s healthcare, infrastructure investment or education and training programs, the purse strings are drawn tight. We need a combination of smart expenditure on investment and sensible tax policy that promotes growth without giving away the farm.  This budget provides neither. It isn’t even close.   That said, I, and many of my colleagues in the New Democrat Coalition, stand ready to reach across the aisle on actual bipartisan, permanent tax reform that simplifies the code and makes it fairer.  We are also willing to work together to make the hard choices necessary to craft a fiscally responsible budget. But, today, I will not endorse this folly."

This is totally unacceptable. I urge GSA to move forward on an alternative plan to provide a new, secure consolidated headquarters and report back to Congress as quickly as possible."
4076,RepTedLieu,Democrat,Today I introduced the Legal Services for Homeless Veterans Act. This legislation would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to enter agreements with third parties to provide pro bono legal services to homeless and at-risk Veterans across the country.   We must do more to fuel the partnerships between civil legal-aid and community health and housing organizations that are doing cutting-edge work to address Veteran homelessness in Los Angeles and across the nation.

Lemanu Peleti Mauga and I had the honor to sit down with Secretary of State Tillerson about issues that American Samoa faces. Read my press release here:  Washington, D.C. –Tuesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata met with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his second stopover in Pago Pago over the past few days to discuss some of the pressing issues facing American Samoa. Also participating in the historic meeting were Gov. Lolo Matalasi Moliga and Lt. Gov. Lemanu Peleti Mauga.   “It was very successful meeting,” stated Amata. “The Governor and I discussed issues pertaining to the Pacific, American Samoa, and the United States’ commitment to the region. This is the second high-profile visitor that American Samoa has welcomed in the past few months, which demonstrates just how receptive and involved the new administration is in regards to the territories…a welcome change,” continued the Congresswoman.  Among the topics discussed were, the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the need for improvements to LBJ Hospital, the lack of adequate air service in American Samoa, the U.S. commitment to our partners in the region, and the ongoing request for more resources and funding for the geographically and economically isolated island.  “I want to thank Secretary Tillerson and his team for their attention to American Samoa and our people.  The Secretary was very gracious, and seemed to really understand what we are trying to do for the people of American Samoa, who love this nation so very much,” stated Amata.  “I look forward to continuing to work with leadership in Washington and here at home to achieve these goals as quickly as possible,” continued Amata.  Following the meeting with the Secretary of State, Congresswoman Amata met with the day’s second visitor to the island, Pacific Command - Commander, USN Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr.  During the meeting, the Congresswoman raised several issues with the Admiral including, the possibility of reinstating the Military Airlift Command (MAC) flights to and from American Samoa.  “Admiral Harris is a good man who expressed his respect for the people of American Samoa, and our loyalty and service to the United States.  He also understood the need for the MAC flights, and assured me that he would work with me to see if we can get them back to the island,” said Amata.  “These flights would be a great service in getting our people in need of emergency medical attention to hospitals that can treat them.  I will continue to do all I can to get the flights back and make sure that our people can receive medical care when they need it most,” concluded the Congresswoman."

4095,senatorfeinstein,Democrat,"We’re introducing an updated Assault Weapons Ban for one reason: so that after every mass shooting with a military-style assault weapon, the American people will know that a tool to reduce these massacres is sitting in the Senate, ready for debate and a vote.  This bill won’t stop every mass shooting, but it will begin removing these weapons of war from our streets. The first Assault Weapons Ban was just starting to show an effect when the NRA stymied its reauthorization in 2004. Yes, it will be a long process to reduce the massive supply of these assault weapons in our country, but we’ve got to start somewhere.  To those who say now isn’t the time, they’re right—we should have extended the original ban 13 years ago, before hundreds more Americans were murdered with these weapons of war.

It is profoundly alarming that Mr. Flynn was allowed to stay in his position for weeks after it was clear he misled the White House and the public about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In the end, it was media reports and public pressure, not the irresponsible and possibly illegal interactions with the Russian government, that forced Mr. Flynn’s resignation.

This bill would make Social Security fairer to seniors by requiring the program to use the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) to calculate cost of living adjustments for retirement benefits. This would increase benefits and better ensure that cost of living adjustments (COLA) in Social Security actually reflect the real rising costs for seniors and disabled people in America. From 1982 to 2011, CPI-E rose at an annual average rate of 3.1 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for the methods that are currently used."

Between 1990 and 2010, prior to passage of the new flight safety rules, passenger airline accidents led to more than 1,100 fatalities.

4146,CongressmanWarrenDavidson,Republican,"The Republican Party Platform and the House’s Better Way agenda are both in agreement that Obamacare must be fully repealed and then replaced with free-market solutions. It is shameful that the House could not produce and pass a bill this week that reflected these commitments.  In fact, as we made progress toward those commitments, the current bill lost votes. Republicans must now go back to the drawing board, together, to formulate a plan that does what we promised and can garner broad Republican support.   People often ask about my biggest surprise in Congress. Normally, my answer is that there are no whiteboards. Whiteboards are used to collaborate and solve problems. This setback shows that Republicans need more collaboration, not less. The path to this ‘binary choice’ with no amendments and an artificial deadline, driven by an anniversary date rather than progress on the bill, have caused this pause. This delay must not be fatal to our commitment to solve the health care problem by honoring the promises Republicans have made in every election since 2010.  Despite this setback, I appreciate the willingness of President Donald Trump to work together throughout this process. I was stunned to see as we made progress toward repealing Obamacare’s one-size fits all approach, others lost their resolve. We are duty bound to honor the promises we made. The American people are counting on us to repeal Obamacare and enact policies that lower their health care costs. I remain hopeful that we can accomplish this mission."

4175,USRepKathyCastor,Democrat,"On the Centennial of President John F. Kennedy's birth, there are important parallels we can call upon to keep America moving forward. He said, ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty."" President Kennedy taught us that being the leader of the free world relies less on thumping your chest and more on searching your heart and standing up for freedom. Perhaps his greatest legacy is his pragmatic and at the same time romantic belief that as Americans – even with our many differences – there is no challenge we cannot face and overcome, if we pull together.     Because of his close win in 1960, President Kennedy often reminded himself how hard he had to work and of the need to understand opposing issues in order to be the President for all in a diverse America. President Kennedy was unique and stands today as the embodiment of the Greatest Generation which stood up to doctrines of ultra-nationalism and vile racist views that were accepted in many corners. In the course of fighting these doctrines and the armies that advanced them, his generation had a clear understanding that their diversity was a strength. President Kennedy once said, that we couldn’t end our differences but, “at least we can make the world safe for diversity"".  As Americans, we must continue President Kennedy’s call – ensure our country embraces its diversity,  appreciate the strength that has always flowed from it, and continue to be a beacon for the dignity for each individual and freedom across the globe."

4194,RepLowenthal,Democrat,"Last night, I attended President Trump’s address to Congress. The President's tone and demeanor was certainly more in keeping with the stature of the office. However, the bar has fallen so low that toned-down anger and a lack of invective seems refreshing. More worrying is that despite the more stately wrapping, the message was essentially the same misinformed nativist populism.   On immigration, the President continued painting immigrants as the boogeymen behind all that plagues our society. Perhaps most frightening was his plan to create an anti-immigrant propaganda arm for the White House to use in convincing the public that immigrants are, as the President has said before, ""rapists and murderers.""   On healthcare, the President laid out the broad strokes of his plan to work with the Republican Congress to eliminate and possibly replace the Affordable Care Act. Judging by the President's comments, his administration's plan will inject chaos into the healthcare system while guaranteeing that fewer people get worse coverage for more money.     The President's speech was also disappointing for the many things he did not mention. First, he did not mention that the FBI and all of our intelligence agencies agree that Russia, one of our nation’s major geopolitical adversaries, attempted to influence the Presidential election that brought him into office. He also didn't mention the communications between his campaign team and Russia prior to the election. And, he failed to note the extensive business contacts so many on his team have with Russia.  He also failed to mention climate change. Although this is not surprising given his nomination of a unabashed foe of the EPA to head the department and his administration’s decision to redact climate change from any acknowledgement on the White House website. In fact, the President spent far more time talking about how he plans to slash environmental regulations that protect Americans every day.   All in all, last night's speech showed me that President Trump can perform to minimum expectations of a president. While I hope that he does not return to his past pattern of division and anger, I have my doubts."

Meanwhile, the United States has lacked a comprehensive strategy to meet the multifaceted threat Iran poses. The goals President Trump presented in his speech today are a welcomed long overdue change. They offer the United States a path forward that centers our policy towards Iran on its destabilizing regional ambitions rather than its nuclear program alone. I look forward to learning more about the specifics of this strategy, and the Senate Armed Services Committee will conduct thorough oversight of our military’s role in it.  Iran has routinely threatened the United States and its neighbors for decades. It is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Its support of the murderous Assad regime has contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the displacement of millions, destabilizing nations across the Middle East. Its continued development and testing of ballistic missiles flouts international law. Its rampant abuse of human rights within its own borders and around the Middle East is horrific. And it has the blood of hundreds of American soldiers on its hands from its support of anti-American terrorist groups and militias throughout the region. And yet, despite this long track record of Iranian malign activities, the Obama administration consistently treated Iran narrowly as a non-proliferation problem rather than as a geopolitical one. This legacy of failure casts a long shadow on our present situation.    I did not support the nuclear deal at the time it was proposed, and many of its specific terms will make it harder to pursue the comprehensive strategy we need. In that sense, I agree with the President that the deal is not in the vital national interests of the United States. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress on additional legislation to increase sanctions and other pressure to hold Iran accountable for its broader destructive behavior in the region. I am also eager to collaborate with our partners and allies to revisit the most problematic provisions of the nuclear deal, and support a unified, forceful international front in the event that Iran materially breaches the terms of the agreement."

4203,senatorbencardin,Democrat,"""America first,"" or America for sale? That's the question before us all as President Trump prepares to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at his private club in Florida this week.   Trump has made a number of abrupt policy changes toward China lately. In February, he suddenly switched his stance on the key issue of Taiwan’s status — in favor of China’s preferred policy.  When asked about the switch, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that when Trump negotiates, ""the president always gets something.""  The problem is that while it is clear China got something, the administration has refused to tell us what the United States got in return.   The American people deserve to know whether President Trump's and his children's many lucrative businesses are the beneficiaries.  The American people have a right to know whether the president's decision-making is being conducted in their public interest or in his private financial interest.   And that's why he MUST divest his business interests. Immediately. The Founders included the #EmolumentsClause in our Constitution to protect against conflicts of interest exactly like these."

4211,betoorourketx16,Democrat,"I offered several amendments for this week's spending bill. Last night, I made my case in front of the Rules Committee to have a few of them made in order.  The first amendment is to prevent the Dept. of Justice from using eminent domain proceedings to take land from private landowners for the purpose of building a border wall. There are many reasons we shouldn't build a border wall, including the fact that it would impact the rights of private citizens.  The other two amendments are related to women's health. One of which is intended to ensure Medicaid dollars do not exclude qualified health care providers who give critical preventative health care for women and essential family planning. The other requires the government to study the reasons for maternal mortality in our country and find ways to help this problem. Texas has the worst maternal mortality rate in the U.S., and this amendment would be an important step in addressing the issue."

Be sure to follow @susanwbrooks to learn more about our shared Hoosier history and to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth with me. Today, we’re honoring the Armstrong family of Westfield, Indiana. Jefferson Armstrong, a former slave from Missouri, arrived in Westfield in 1873. He had 5 sons with his third wife, Sarah, and all 5 served in World War I. The Armstrongs were the only family in Indiana with 5 sons wearing the American military uniform at the same time during the war. The second oldest, Sgt. Irven Armstrong was a life-long educator. During his service in 1918, his students at IPS #17 wrote him letters which are the inspiration behind the Indiana Historical Society play, 'Sincerely, Sgt. Armstrong.' Sgt. Armstrong returned to Indianapolis after the war and continued to teach. He retired as head of the History Department at Crispus Attucks High School in 1959, and following retirement, he taught veterans of the Vietnam War."

4224,congressmanraja,Democrat,"Today, the House Republican leadership forced through a budget resolution that would blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit while paving the way to a tax plan that would increase taxes on working families while making it harder for them to save for retirement. Fundamentally, this resolution lays the groundwork for the Republican leadership’s plan to raise taxes on millions of Illinois families by thousands of dollars each year through eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), while making it harder for them to save for retirement by slashing the cap on their 401(k) contributions.

4245,CongressmanWarrenDavidson,Republican,"Proud to have just voted to take the first steps to repeal Obamacare.  Obamacare has failed. It took an already dysfunctional healthcare economy and made it worse. The list of broken promises to fix our healthcare system with the law is long. Rather than fall by $2,500, premiums rose by $4,300, a difference of $6,800. It did not allow Americans to keep their insurance if they liked it. It did not allow Americans to keep their doctor. This is just the first step. Congress must swiftly replace Obamacare with reforms that respect the Constitution and individual liberty.   I do, however have concerns with the budget trajectory this bill establishes.  Leadership in Congress has assured us that today’s vote is simply a vehicle for repealing Obamacare and that future budgets will reflect the fiscal discipline the American people expect of Congress. I look forward to making sure that these promises are fulfilled."
4246,RepJackBergman,Republican,"Today I was proud to join my colleagues in voting in favor of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.

More than that, the NDAA allows us to supply and train our troops, to set a strong national security policy in a dangerous world, and to properly care for our troops and their families. After serving in the Marines for over 40 years, I know firsthand the importance of investing in our national security and supporting our men and women in uniform. This bipartisan legislation will reverse years of dangerous cuts to our nation’s defense priorities. This is Congress’s opportunity to reform and rebuild our military in an age of uncertainty at home and abroad. This is a resources and readiness issue—Congress must give our military the resources it needs to be ready for everchanging threats worldwide."

4296,SenatorTomCotton,Republican,"Today I commemorated Joe Dale Burgess on the Senate floor, an Arkansas veteran who recently died of cancer. WATCH:"
4297,SenatorWhitehouse,Democrat,"Many Americans already get quality health care coverage through single-payer plans. Single-payer veterans’ care is often delivered by government doctors in government hospitals. Single-payer Medicaid is delivered in plans run by individual states. Single-payer Medicare is paid for by government and accepted by providers in every community. Single-payer Tricare covers military families, both in military hospitals and with private physicians. At the same time, unions often have excellent health and benefit plans they have negotiated through collective bargaining. And many employees and retirees are content with health insurance they get through their employers. We must find a way to provide the best aspects of these high-quality plans--namely, economic security and peace of mind--to every American. This is the start of a long and worthy conversation. Thank you, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, for helping to open it up."
4298,RepEsty,Democrat,"Betsy DeVos's baffling response to Senator Chris Murphy's question about keeping kids safe from gun violence at school suggests this isn't an issue she's given any serious thought. As a parent, and as a representative for so many families that have been devastated by gun violence at school, I find her answer horrifying."
4299,RepTedLieu,Democrat,"ICYMI: Watch my weekend interview with MSNBC's Sheinelle Jones. I talked about Trump's Syria strikes, Assad's use of chemical weapons, the threat of North Korea, and further investigating Trump's ties to Russia."
4300,senatortammybaldwin,Democrat,"In 2012, I was elected to the U.S. Senate and the people of Wisconsin did not send me here to take their health care away.  I took to the Senate Floor to demand that my Republican colleagues listen -- not to me -- but to the calls from people that we are here to represent and fight for."
4301,senatortomudall,Democrat,"In NM, supporting the arts also supports the growth of new small businesses (and jobs) like @cacaosantafe, a coffee and chocolate shop in a growing arts and business district in Santa Fe. I loved learning about -- and tasting -- chocolate during my visit to highlight #smallbusinesssaturday.  Small businesses are the backbone of New Mexico’s economy, and supporting Main Street helps build an economy that works for every corner of #NewMexico. When you #shopsmall you support local businesses and good jobs -- and keep more dollars in our communities.  One in 10 jobs in New Mexico is related to arts, culture, and tourism. And in many communities, businesses and the arts support each other and make our state more vibrant. That's why I'm working to support both small businesses and the arts through legislation like my CREATE Act, a bill to help boost arts businesses, entrepreneurs, and jobs in New Mexico and across the country. Together, we can build an economy that works for every corner of #NewMexico."

4303,repsaludcarbajal,Democrat,"California has no interest in expanding oil drilling off our coast. The risks to the health of our local economies and delicate ecosystems are simply too great. Thank you to my colleague Congressman Jared Huffman, a fellow UCSB Gaucho, for joining me in this fight against future drilling and for delivering loud and clear, our message to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke."

4306,RepToddRokita,Republican,"Navient employs more than 2,000 Hoosiers.  The company services student loans and manages those loans for more than 12 million customers.  The company partners with the Department of Education to help borrowers find the repayments options that work for them.  Yesterday, I was able to visit their facility in Fishers to meet with their employees and learn about how Navient operates."
4307,RepStephMurphy,Democrat,"""The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol is reassigning 10 border patrol agents away from the Orlando International Airport to the Mexican border for the next six months, a move that led airport officials and U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy to protest Friday that the already overwhelmed airport security will be seriously compromised."""
4308,RepJimCosta,Democrat,"It's been 75 years since February 19, 1942, the day when President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066.  Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II, 120,000 individuals of Japanese descent were forced to leave their homes and were ordered into prison camps. Japanese Americans, including thousands from our Central Valley, had their civil rights and human rights completely violated by the U.S. government. It was a very sad and dark time in our nation's history. I have deep respect and gratitude for the Japanese Americans in our Valley and throughout the nation who tell their stories and their family's stories because we must never forget!"

4321,senatormenendez,Democrat,"Imagine finding out that you have to pay taxes ON your taxes.   That’s exactly what Republicans' idea of tax reform means. They want to eliminate the State and Local Tax Deduction, taking away a deduction worth $10,000 just so they can give big fat tax breaks to a handful of the super-wealthy and giant corporations.  It’s a plan we have to stop."
4322,SenatorRandPaul,Republican,"This morning, Senator McConnell informed me that the plan for today is to take up the 2015 clean repeal bill as I've urged. If that is the plan, I will vote to proceed to have this vote. I also now believe we will be able to defeat the new spending and bailouts. I've been told by leadership their bill would now need 60 votes to pass, votes they do not have. Therefore I believe it will fail. If we cannot pass full, clean 2015 repeal, I've also been told we will vote on whatever version of CLEAN repeal we can pass. Repealing mandates & taxes, without new spending and bailouts. This is the path I've been urging, and what I discussed with President Trump. If this is indeed the plan, I will vote to proceed and I will vote for any all measures that are clean repeal."

4326,RepMcKinley,Republican,Great day full of productive meetings and visits in Washington today!
4327,RepAnnWagner,Republican,"In 2012, the people of Missouri's 2nd Congressional District sent me to Congress, and I promised them that I would find a way for families to keep more of their hard-earned money. Today, we are delivering on that promise and no media hyperbole or partisan backlash will change the bottom line. This bill cuts taxes for middle income Missourians, allows American businesses to flourish, and paves the way for an increase of good-paying jobs.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is pro-family tax reform that expands the Child Tax Credit, doubles the standard deduction, lowers individual rates, and preserves the adoption tax credit and retirement savings options I fought hard to keep. Most importantly—after 30 years of a ballooning tax code—this historic tax reform sets the stage for American families and our economy to prosper."

4330,SenDuckworth,Democrat,"The President yesterday broke yet another campaign promise – this time it’s his promise to support those who wear the uniform and defend this great nation. With the stroke of his pen, the President robbed American Veterans, servicemembers and millions of hard-working families of their right to take bad actors like Wells Fargo and EquiFax to court. The brave men and women who risk their lives to defend our freedom deserve nothing but support from our nation’s leadership – not another broken campaign promise."

4335,SenatorHassan,Democrat,"Caring for older loved ones often falls to women, causing many to exit the workforce. We need to support these family caregivers, which is why I helped introduce a bill to provide modest retirement compensation for those who care for a loved one."

4343,SenatorToddYoung,Republican,"I've been intently focused on these so-called distressed communities since taking office, making several visits to learn how policy makers can better serve the hard-working Hoosiers who live there.

4349,SenatorSherrodBrown,Democrat,"This is a step in the right direction, but customers cannot be sure their rights are truly protected until Equifax makes this policy clear for all products and websites. The fact that it took a public shaming to force Equifax to drop forced arbitration from TrustID, is further proof why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule is needed. -SB"

4375,95696782238.0,Democrat,"During his Senate confirmation hearing, Jeff Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not have communications with the Russian government during Mr. Trump’s campaign. We now know this statement, made under oath, was a lie. Attorney General Sessions must resign immediately, or President Trump must fire him, and the FBI must launch an investigation into his actions.    Mr. Sessions no longer has any credibility to oversee the FBI’s investigation of the Trump administration’s connections to Russian agents. For weeks, Democrats have called for an independent investigation of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, both throughout his campaign and in his administration. Such an investigation is now necessary beyond a shadow of a doubt.   Hardly a day goes by without new shocking revelations coming to light about the Trump Administration’s improprieties. The American people deserve to know the truth about Mr. Trump’s connections to Russia, and they deserve to know without delay."

4380,RepDaveBrat,Republican,"Swift and decisive military action was required when Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad used sarin gas to barbarically murder innocent men, women, and children this week. The images from the chemical attacks launched by Assad on his own people are horrific.  Diplomatic efforts by the international community, including the UN Security Council, to reason with Assad have been ignored. Previous efforts by the United States to influence the region have done nothing to change the status quo of a ruthless dictator who has no regard for the value of human life.  We do not need more meaningless red lines. It is the moral imperative for America to lead. Now that the initial attack and element of surprise is over, Congress has a constitutional obligation to hear from President Trump and agree on a strategy for engagement before we place our Armed Forces on the ground in Syria."
4381,RepColleenHanabusa,Democrat,"This week brought two office birthdays, Ainoa Naniole, our Honolulu District Director, and Liz Songvilay, our Legislative Director in Washington, DC.

4383,MarkRWarner,Democrat,"The Trump Administration executive order that indefinitely suspends the Syrian refugee program and pauses visas from Muslim countries runs counter to our American values. While I have always been open to a pause on our refugee program to ensure appropriate time for intelligence and law enforcement experts to ensure we protect our national security, these actions by the President presume the solution before the review is complete. It is a policy targeting Muslims that national security experts have testified would harm, not help, our national security interests. I join the interfaith community in Virginia and around the country in objecting to these moves, and I will work in Congress to block an effort which trades dubious increases in U.S. security for certain alienation of partners with whom we must cooperate to address terrorism."

4394,DianaDeGette,Democrat,"Leave it to House Republicans to make a bad bill even worse. In the latest version of the GOP’s disastrous #ACA repeal, states would be allowed to kick new mothers off Medicaid if they can’t find work within 60 days of giving birth. This provision, tucked into a bill that was made public late at night, would turn back the clock on women across our country by violating family leave protections. American families deserve better than House Republicans’ obvious contempt for low-income Americans."

We need to send an aid package to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the same way we provided relief for Texas and Florida. More aid is needed to deal with the devastation by the consecutive hurricanes that have destroyed these islands. To give less to some U.S. citizens is a travesty and an insult to the American citizens of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We should not have to wait until October to receive the request of increased funding. Congress needs to fully fund an aid package NOW and ensure that they have all the means available to them to recover from this disaster today, and into the future."

This funding helps local law enforcement agencies working to reduce their backlogs of untested rape kits. DNA analysis has been revolutionary in helping catch criminals and prevent further crimes from occurring.  But when evidence is sitting on a shelf somewhere waiting to be tested, that means assailants are still at large and could be assaulting more victims. The backlog of untested rape kits across this country is shameful, and we need to commit the resources necessary to get them tested.

The essential work of restoring power to Puerto Rico demands a contract that protects the best interests of the people of Puerto Rico and holds every contractor accountable. The current contract does neither and only raises further questions due to the clause preventing the government from reviewing its costs. If Whitefish Energy is unable to respond to emergencies without a no-audit clause, the people of Puerto Rico deserve a contractor who can. I hope this contract will be canceled to allow for one accountable to taxpayers as we continue to eliminate provisions banning government oversight from all contracts. https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-krishnamoorthi-backs-gov-rossell-s-request-cancellation-whitefish"

He grew up like every other American kid — he didn’t know he was undocumented until he was in middle school. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has made all the difference for Carlos. Today, he is studying to be a mechanical engineer at NMSU, is a volunteer firefighter, and works in a local restaurant.  DACA gave Carlos legal status so he can live out his dreams of staying with his family and working to give back to his community. It even allowed him to travel and reconnect with his dad for the first time. But with President Trump reportedly planning to cancel DACA, Carlos' future is in jeopardy.  I asked Carlos to share his story in this video so you all could hear it. He said, “I think we as Dreamers, we have proven ourselves of being worthy of being in the United States. We were given wings when we got DACA permits. … I want to let you know that Dreamers need your support.”   Stand with me to keep fighting to spread the word about this important program for Carlos and the 800,000 Dreamers like him. #SaveDACA"

Only those Veterans with honorable service will be able to apply for the ID card, which will provide proof of military service, and may be accepted by retailers in lieu of the standard DD-214 form to obtain promotional discounts and other services where offered to Veterans.  “The new Veterans Identification Card provides a safer and more convenient and efficient way for most Veterans to show proof of service,” said VA Secretary Dr. David J. Shulkin. “With the card, Veterans with honorable service to our nation will no longer need to carry around their paper DD-214s to obtain Veteran discounts and other services.”  The VIC provides a more portable and secure alternative for those who served the minimum obligated time in service, but did not meet the retirement or medical discharge threshold. Veterans who served in the armed forces, including the reserve components, and who have a discharge of honorable or general (under honorable conditions) can request a VIC. To request a VIC, Veterans must visit vets.gov, click on “Apply for Printed Veteran ID Card” on the bottom left of the page and sign in or create an account.  Veterans who apply for a card should receive it within 60 days and can check delivery status of their cards at vets.gov.

In San Diego, an estimated 38,000 people are currently eligible for DACA or could be in the future. They are our friends, neighbors, and co-workers who have known no other home than the United States. DACA was established because Republicans in Congress failed to even allow a vote on comprehensive immigration reform in 2013.

4489,RepCheri,Democrat,"In my latest Hear from the Heartland video, I spoke with Amber from Sterling, Illinois, about her pre-existing condition and concerns with Trumpcare. She has a condition that causes her body to develop blood hemangiomas on her colon and small intestines – a potentially life threatening condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Amber regularly had to get blood and iron infusions, which cost her $3,000 each time and created significant medical debt. Because of the Affordable Care Act, Amber can now get the treatment she needs at prices she can afford.  President Trump promised ‘insurance for everybody,’ but if Washington Republicans move ahead with their plan to take health care away from millions of Americans, it’s people like Amber who will be forced into debt as their out of pocket costs explode. Hardworking men and women like Amber aren’t asking for a handout – they just want stable, affordable health care that covers life’s unexpected challenges. Instead of pushing for a dangerous repeal of the Affordable Care Act without replacement, the Republican Majority should reach across the aisle and work with Democrats to fix what’s broken in health care and bring down costs for all Americans."

An existing regulation makes an exception for veterans – who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, insurance through the VA – so they have the support and flexibility to purchase insurance on the individual marketplace if they choose.   The VETERAN Act puts this regulation into law so veterans will continue to have access to help purchase health insurance – with Obamacare’s subsidies and the monthly tax credits provided by the American Health Care Act, when they take effect."

Read my press release here:  Washington, DC –Thursday, President Trump signed S. 544 into law yesterday, which eliminates the termination date for the successful Veteran’s Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014.  “I was proud to support the House version of this bill, when it passed through the House Veterans Affairs Committee markup.  It is essential that our veterans have access to the treatments they need, and this bill will ensure that.  Our veterans in American Samoa still need better access here locally, but this will allow them to continue to see private physicians in Honolulu if the VA cannot provide the care they need at Tripler Army Medical Center,” continued the Congresswoman.  Specifically, S. 544 eliminates the termination date for the Choice Act, while also making the VA the primary payer for medical care for non-service connected disabilities.  “I want to thank President Trump and my colleagues in both the House and the Senate for making make Veteran’s health issues a top priority, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to improve the access and quality of care our veterans receive here in American Samoa,” concluded Amata."

Yet President Trump has been unwilling to respond seriously, leaving Congress with the urgent responsibility to hold Vladimir Putin accountable. At the same time, ballistic missile programs in North Korea and Iran pose a global threat. The United States needs to send a clear message that such behavior needs to end. I'm grateful to my colleagues of both parties in the House and Senate with whom I worked over the last few weeks to produce this tough sanctions legislation.

4525,RepLeeZeldin,Republican,"Getting this bill done and getting this bill done right should not have been a binary choice. My goal in this tax reform mission has always been to ensure the hard working men and women of Long Island keep more of their paycheck, reduce their cost of living, and are able to save more for retirement. Unfortunately, this bill is not the tax relief many Long Islanders had hoped for.   There are many good aspects of this bill, including a necessary reduction in the corporate tax rate, but it should not be done on the backs of ANY hard working, middle income taxpayers. That was totally avoidable and I still don't understand why spending cuts couldn’t have been used as a more responsible pay for.   On balance, this bill remains a geographic redistribution of wealth, taking extra money from a place like New York to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere. New York is a net contributor that now will be contributing even more. This bill chooses winners and losers in a way that could have and should have been avoided.   While adding back in the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction to a $10,000 cap was progress, it was not enough progress. While I support fully maintaining the SALT deduction, a better policy if a change was to be made would have been a phase down of SALT over a period of time to a level that fully protects middle income itemizers. With that being said, all New Yorkers must confront the reality that our deduction is so high because our state and local taxes are so high. ALL levels of government must work on tax relief moving forward."

4555,SenatorHeidiHeitkamp,Democrat,"In June and while getting treatment to fight her stage 4 breast cancer, Ranae Byre from Burlington traveled to Washington, D.C. to share her concerns about the Republican health care bill the Senate was considering at that time because she knew it was too important a fight to just sit back. Unfortunately, many of the provisions that Ranae was concerned about in June are being threatened again today in the Republicans’ latest attempt at a health care bill. The Graham-Cassidy health care bill would be bad for North Dakota. It would repeal tax credits that more than 17,000 North Dakotans rely on to make health insurance affordable. It’s also projected that if this bill were to pass, the number of uninsured North Dakotans would double by 2019. Folks like Ranae stepped up and had their voices heard last time – and it worked. We need to do the same this time and stop this horrible bill from passing in the U.S. Senate. Instead, we need Republicans and Democrats to work together on commonsense improvements to make health care work better – just as I’ve been working to do."

For seven years I have fought to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to make it work better for America’s middle-class families, but I have consistently opposed repeal without a better replacement.  Unfortunately, this replacement would have made our healthcare system significantly worse, harming tens of millions of Americans, including some of our most vulnerable.  It is good for the American people that this bill has been stopped.   It’s time for Republicans to sit down with Democrats and make the fixes to our healthcare system that will help rein in the costs of healthcare and expand coverage without diminishing care.  The American people want politicians to stop playing politics with their healthcare and start problem-solving; it is about time Washington listens."

4577,SenatorKamalaHarris,Democrat,"“I was awarded my high school diploma early and because of a bad home situation, and I chose to join the military. I joined the Air Force in March of 1986, three months before my official high school graduation. I was assigned to be an Aircraft Armament Systems Specialist, which is essentially putting bombs, missiles and bullets on an in aircraft. Everywhere I went during my time in the service I was the only female doing what I did. I now work for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as an Environmental Manager. Recently, I was deployed on Emergency Operations to work on the California wildfires and Houston, TX for Hurricane Harvey relief. I believe a patriot is someone that puts their country above themselves, puts the betterment and protection of that country first, and makes defending the ideals that this country was founded on a priority. I think the country needs to move in a direction where we can share our differences without division, move towards more acceptance and understanding, upholding the Constitution, and towards a place where we want to bring everyone up, not only people that look like us, agree with our views or politics, or that we think are ‘good enough.’” – Deborah, Loma Rica"

4580,CongressmanMattGaetz,Republican,"In honor of Veterans Day, this week I will be sharing stories from our district's wounded veterans. On behalf of a grateful nation, we thank them and their families for their commitment, sacrifice, and heroism.    In order to support the continued success of these brave men and women, I will be introducing the WARRIOR Act later this week, which will allow the DoD to pay the cost of veterans’ and disabled servicemembers’ travel costs to military adaptive sports programs like the Warrior Games.  ""I am writing to explain how my involvement with the Air Force Wounded Warrior (AFW2) program has enriched and given meaning to my life. Emily Esfahani Smith, a professor in positive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, researched the characteristics of a meaningful life.  She found that those who find meaning in their life are more resilient, do better in in school/work, live longer, and are less likely to de by suicide.   These characteristics of a meaningful life revolve around four-pillars:  1. Belonging – Relationships where you are valued and you value others.   2. Purpose – Using your strengthens to serve others. …the Why that drives you forward.    3. Transcendence – Rising above everyday life to experience a higher reality.  Losing yourself in an activity. Flow State.  4. Story Telling – The story you tell yourself about yourself. How we became who we are.   During my 12-years in the Air Force I created and strengthened each of these pillars of a meaningful life.  I had deep meaningful relationships with those I served with, a sense of purpose in my work, transcendence, and powerful story in who I was and how I became an EOD Team Leader disarming explosives in Iraq and Afghanistan.  After being injured in Afghanistan and subsequently retiring from the Air Force, I lost each of these pillars; which removed much of the meaning from my life.  Fortunately, programs hosted by the AFW2 allow individuals like me, who have left the military and subsequently lost their sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning, a chance to start rebuilding these aspects of their new life.  These programs allow individuals to create authentic relationships with their teammates, coaches, families, volunteers, spectators, and other.  Additionally, these programs lead to a newfound and increased sense of purpose while improving their health; and allow individuals to reframe a story of tragedy, into a strength-based story of triumph.  Unfortunately, the benefits of these types of programs are now limited to Active Duty and TDRL (Temporary Disabled Retirement List) because of funding.  I would argue the population who needs these programs most, the permanently retired service member who has transitioned and lost their sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning, are no longer funded to attend these events.  It is my hope that these programs will once again be opened to permanently retired service members.  In my opinion, there would be no greater way to address many of the issues faced by a transitioning service member.  Sincerely,  Adam Popp, USAF"""
4581,RepDWS,Democrat,"Today is Equal Pay Day, one of the most disturbing dates on the calendar. It marks just how far into the next year that a woman has to work in order to earn the same wages a man earned in the previous year. That disparity is now 80 cents on the dollar, which means it took 94 days to reach this point.  For women of color, the gap is even wider, with African-American women earning an average of 63 cents, and Hispanic women making 54 cents compared to white men.  This gap is a national embarrassment.  It not only affects women – it affects  the whole economy because American women are the sole or co-breadwinner in two thirds of all the families with children.  When women’s wages are depressed, families can’t adequately pay for groceries, rent, utilities, health care and child care.  Worse, the lost wages compound throughout a woman’s life, totaling an average of $418,000 by retirement. That’s the equivalent of a home mortgage, or college tuition for a family’s children. And this same disparity chases behind women into retirement, too, since they receive less Social Security or retirement payouts due to a lifetime of depressed wages.  But there is a way to address this inequity. Democrats are calling upon Congressional Republicans to work across the aisle for every woman in this country by passing the long-overdue Paycheck Fairness Act. This law would update the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and provide effective legal remedies to the millions of women who are not being paid equal wages for the work they do that is equal to men every day. If we can wield this legislation and other political and cultural weapons against gender discrimination, some day we can retire this ugly date from our calendar."

Defense Secretary Mattis testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that we are not winning in Afghanistan. And yet, six months into the new administration, it still has not delivered a strategy. We cannot keep going like this.

4678,RepTedLieu,Democrat,"As a Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have attended classified and unclassified briefings and hearings on North Korea, listened to foreign policy experts, and studied the region. Last year I traveled to South Korea, met with the Defense Minister, and visited U.S. troops serving there. After reflecting on the provocative actions and comments by the Trump Administration, I have concluded that the Administration's march toward war with North Korea is nuts.  There are no good U.S. military options for North Korea. When I served on active duty in the Air Force, I was stationed at Andersen AFB in Guam and traveled to bases in Japan and South Korea. It was clear then that any U.S. attack on North Korea could quickly escalate to an all-out war in the region, resulting in millions killed or injured. That remains the situation today.  While I agree North Korea is a threat to U.S. national security, the regime is still years away from being able to strike the U.S. homeland. War must always be the last resort. The Administration threatening a 'major conflict' and saying 'the sword stands ready' is irresponsible and can lead to catastrophic miscalculations. Instead, the Trump Administration needs to use all the levers of U.S. power, such as increased economic sanctions, and pursue further diplomacy. That requires articulating a clear and consistent strategy and fully funding the State Department—two things this Administration has unfortunately refused to do."
4679,SenatorKamalaHarris,Democrat,"Today’s decision is an attack on our right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Yet again, the Administration is pursuing a policy that favors short-term corporate profits over the creation of new jobs and sustained economic growth for our nation, and sides with polluters over the interests of America’s families. In this proposal, the Administration willfully and deliberately ignores the global threat of climate change and discounts the public health impact of air pollution. It should be no surprise that Administrator Pruitt wants to reach a legal conclusion that allows fossil fuel companies off the hook. While this Administration continues its assault on our environment, California will continue to lead the way in acting on climate. In California, we know that protecting public health and the environment helps our economy, and in the United States Senate I will continue to work to hold this Administration and the EPA accountable."

She had been accepted into several of the country’s most prestigious music schools. But Tereza had a problem. Her parents had brought her to the United States when she was two, and she was undocumented. After hearing Tereza’s story, I introduced the Dream Act. This bipartisan legislation gives a path to citizenship to immigrants who came to the United States as children.   The American people need to know that the Trump administration’s deportation clock is ticking for these young people. Beginning on March 5, 2018, every workday for the following two years, approximately 1,400 Dreamers will lose their work permits and be subject to deportation. Teachers will be forced to leave behind their students, nurses will be forced to leave behind their patients, first responders will be forced to leave their posts, and soldiers who are willing to die for their country will be forced to leave the Army.

The lives of billions of innocent people, and the future of the world as we know it, is at stake. Should President Trump launch a first strike against North Korea, it could easily escalate into a nuclear war with catastrophic consequences. A preemptive strike would also incentivize North Korea to attack the 23,468 U.S. military troops currently stationed in South Korea.    That’s why I’ve joined numerous colleagues in introducing legislation to stop President Trump from disregarding the Constitution and launching a first strike attack on North Korea without Congressional approval.   It’s important to note that this legislation does not stop the United States from responding and launching an attack if North Korea attacks the U.S. or its allies first.   The bill’s purpose is simply to put safeguards on a process that gives the President single-handed control to launch a first attack – even a nuclear attack – without a Congressional declaration of war, as the Constitution requires.  As always, diplomacy, not war, is our best chance and our strongest tool in dealing with nations like North Korea.

I applaud President Trump's swift and decisive action to show that America will no longer stand on the sideline as innocent men, women, and babies are brutally killed in Syria. In the coming weeks, I urge President Trump to work with Congress to develop a clear and comprehensive strategy for Syria and the surrounding region."
4720,RepRoKhanna,Democrat,Trump's choice to sign the transgender military ban is shameful. There is no place for discrimination in our armed forces. Trans rights are human rights.

4721,RepBrianBabin,Republican,"Currently, America is one of only seven countries – including North Korea, Vietnam, and China – that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks, a point when science shows unborn babies feel pain. Ending these lives is both cruel and inhumane. It is my firm belief that we can – and should – do better as a nation. And today, I’m very pleased that the House will consider legislation to do just that by protecting unborn children from abortion after 20 weeks."

4730,CongressmanGarretGraves,Republican,"Tonight and earlier this week the U.S. House of Representatives passed critical legislation to provide important relief to Louisiana disaster victims. The emergency appropriations bill and tax relief bill include the following:     *Permanently eliminates “Duplication of Benefits” policy that considers disaster loans duplicative of grants – and prevents disaster victims from participating in Restore Louisiana program grants;   *Provides an estimated $600,000,000 in additional disaster recovery dollars so our communities can recover and build back stronger;   *Eliminates IRS tax penalties on early retirement withdrawals for flood recovery and makes flood losses tax deductible (H.R. 1);   *Clears legal and funding obstacles to complete the Comite Diversion project with billions of dollars in federal Community Development Block Grant and Hazard Mitigation funding.  This is a huge win and early Christmas present for Louisiana.  We have been working on these problems for months and now have duplication of benefits fixed, additional federal recovery funding, tax relief and a clear path to complete the Comite Diversion project.  https://garretgraves.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/critical-relief-louisiana-disaster-victims-way"

And we’re working with new VA Secretary David Shulkin to institute badly-needed reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

This legislation would protect unborn children after 20 weeks gestation, except in cases of incest, rape, and the life of the mother.  Currently, the United States is one of only seven nations that allow elective late term abortions after 20 weeks gestation, putting us in the dubious company of countries such as China and North Korea. In many developed nations, including western European countries, abortion is limited after 14 weeks and countries such as France and Germany have limitations starting at 12 weeks.  Late term abortion is inconsistent in a country where today, doctors are saving babies younger than 22 weeks."

His use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians has struck the moral conscience of the United States and the world.  I’m supportive of the Trump administration’s decision to launch air strikes in response to Assad’s assault on his own people. Going forward, President Trump must explain to the American people what his strategy is to bring the broader Syrian conflict to a close and end the threat of terrorism that this conflict has fueled. Congress must also provide constructive oversight. Furthermore, this administration must be fully transparent with Congress and the American people regarding troop deployments to the battlefield. - J.S."

4749,CongresswomanAnnieKuster,Democrat,"At a time when sexual assault and sexual harassment are pervasive on both college and high school campuses, it’s deeply concerning that President-elect Trump’s pick to head the Department of Education has supported a group that looks to make it more difficult for victims to come forward. Both women and men are at a high risk of being sexually assaulted while in college and they often face barriers to coming forward and reporting incidents, putting others at risk of attack by repeat offenders. Sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes in our country and we can’t afford to roll back protections for survivors of campus sexual assault. Our focus must be on working to foster a system that supports victims. I’ll continue to advocate on behalf of survivors of sexual assault and work to grow the dialogue about how we can change the culture of sexual assault in our nation. Read more here:"

4760,RepBobGibbs,Republican,"One thing I like to say is when a business owner or a non-profit administrator comes across a new government regulation, they should be able to say ""This makes sense, we ought to do this."" Too often they're forced to comply with regulations that are too costly, contradictory to other rules, or just don't make a lot of sense. Some regulations can have a major economic impact, and the total cost of federal regulations cost the economy nearly $2 trillion in 2012 according to a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers. That's why we passed the REINS Act earlier this year. It requires that major regulations, those that cost the economy $100 million or more, come to Congress for an up or down vote."

4765,RepJackieWalorski,Republican,"In his first address to Congress, President Trump presented a positive vision and a bold agenda for our country. From jump-starting our economy and growing jobs to rebuilding our military and protecting our veterans, Congress and the president are committed to working together for real solutions that make a difference in people’s lives.  That’s why we’re working together to fix our broken tax code and make it flatter, simpler, and fairer. We’re rolling back burdensome regulations that are crushing small businesses, manufacturers, and farmers. We’re working to provide relief to the millions of families struggling under Obamacare by repealing and replacing it with a better system that lowers costs, increases choices, and protects patients with pre-existing conditions. And we’re making sure our servicemen and women have the resources they need on the battlefield and the care they deserve when they return home.  The president’s message was one of optimism, unity, and faith in the American spirit – just what this country needs.

This does not mean our work is completed. Additional, market-based reforms will be critical to fully repeal and replace Obamacare, and we will continue to advance those measures.

For too long, America’s strategy in Afghanistan was driven by politics, leading to arbitrary troop caps and unreasonable timetables for troop withdrawal. Where the Obama Administration saw an exit strategy as a kept campaign promise, our enemies saw a window of opportunity and a lack of resolve. No matter how capable our forces, diplomats, and alliances, we could not win with one hand tied behind our back and no definition of victory.   Finally, the gloves are off.

Those actions prompted me to introduce legislation that would have forced DHS to work with and train local law enforcement to apprehend and detain criminal aliens.

Few would have predicted that 16 years later, we would still be fighting what has become America’s longest war.  Unfortunately, since the President made his announcement of an Afghanistan strategy, Congress still does not know many of the crucial strategic details. This is completely unacceptable.  We want to be your partners. But we will not be a rubber stamp for any policy or president. We must be well-informed. We must be convinced of the merits of the administration’s actions. And unfortunately, we still have far more questions than answers about this new strategy.  We still do not know how the President’s new strategy will better enable us to achieve our stated objectives. In short, it remains unclear why we should be confident that this new strategy could turn the tide in Afghanistan or bring us meaningfully closer to success than its failed predecessors."

Climate change is a global crisis that requires not only international cooperation, but also, the United States’ leadership as the world’s second largest contributor.

4818,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"After months of Donald Trump and his cohorts denying that he is guilty of obstruction of justice, his lawyer now argues that a President cannot be found guilty of obstruction of justice. It's claimed that Trump is above the law and immune from prosecution. As the evidence of his wrongdoing grows, Trump didn’t do it, but if he did, he allegedly cannot be held accountable. Taking a page from Nixon, ""when the President does it, it is not illegal.""  Sounds like the authoritarian approach to government with which around the world Trump appears so enamored."

4828,SenatorTedCruz,Republican,"My priorities from day one in the Senate have been jobs and economic growth. Those are the priorities of Texans all across the state. Texans want more jobs, more opportunity, and higher wages. And we can achieve those priorities by lifting the regulatory burdens of Washington off the backs of small businesses, farmers, ranchers and job creators. By simplifying the tax code, and by repealing Obamacare, which has been the biggest job killer in the country. I am spending every waking moment, day and night, working to deliver on the promises made to the American people and to Texas families.  http://bit.ly/2v3knoB"

4836,CongressmanBradSchneider,Democrat,"We all share the aims outlined by President Trump of a stable and secure Afghanistan and eliminating the terrorist networks harbored there. However, the President’s speech was short on crucial details. Absent a specific strategy to accomplish clearly articulated objectives, as well as support for our diplomatic efforts to secure a political resolution, I fear the United States will be further drawn into an open-ended conflict with no clear path to victory. I urge the Administration to demonstrate to the Congress and American people that there is a comprehensive strategy as soon as possible."
4837,RepRoybalAllard,Democrat,"What an honor to join House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and so many of my fellow LA-area leaders at #CHIRLA (Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights) headquarters to urge Congress to pass my #DreamAct!  We heard from some of the many young #immigrants protected by #DACA.  These young men and women are our teachers, our scientists, our researchers, and our doctors.  They help to improve the quality of life in our neediest communities.  To sign up for DACA, they trusted our government with their personal information.  It would be a disgrace for our government to betray their trust.  Their stories remind us why is it critical for Congress to pass the Dream Act!  #ProtectDreamers"
4838,repdavereichert,Republican,"Today, the Ways and Means Committee held a hearing with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. I talked about how important trade is to Washington and asked Ambassador Lighthizer about the Administration’s plans to expand and strengthen America’s trade relationships with our foreign partners. I strongly believe we must pursue new bilateral agreements because we cannot be left behind as our competitors race forward with other agreements. I look forward to working with the Ambassador and the Administration to make sure we grow America’s economy and increase opportunities for Washington’s farmers, workers, business owners, and consumers.

4839,ChelliePingree,Democrat,"In 2015, U.S. farmers sold $8.7 billion in local food directly to consumers, restaurants, retailers, and other local businesses. But with the right resources, and more help for consumers to buy locally, it could be even more. That's why I'm so proud to introduce HR 3941, the bipartisan Local FARMS Act. Improving programs for farmers, piloting food-as-medicine programs, expanding local food programs for veterans--this bill has a little bit of everything to grow our economy while widening people's access to healthy food.

4841,RepTedBudd,Republican,"Let me take a minute to give an update on what’s going on over in the Senate, in regards to health care.   Yesterday afternoon, the Senate voted in favor of proceeding to debate how we should reform our country’s health system. Over the next couple of days, members of the Senate will debate and vote on many amendments aimed to improve our health care system.   The Constitution requires any bill that seeks to make changes to taxes needs to start here in the House, which is why the Senate could not begin this process until the House passed a bill. In early May, we sent the American Health Care Act over to them. Since then, Senators have been engaged in a lengthy debate on how best to reform our healthcare system. With a divided conference, like ours, finding consensus is never easy.   At the end of this process, it’s my hope that the Senate sends us back a product that will lower premiums for people buying on the individual marketplace and repeals the individual mandate, ensuring that Americans aren’t forced to buy health insurance by the federal government against their own will.   I’ll have more thoughts on this as the week progresses. In the meantime, we will be working."
4842,Representative.Martha.Roby,Republican,"I was honored to host Defense Appropriations Chairwoman Kay Granger for a visit to the 187th Fighter Wing and Maxwell-Gunter AFB this weekend. Her visit comes amid our work to ensure the military is properly funded and as the Air Force nears a decision on where to assign the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. For two years now we have been making the case for why Montgomery and the 187th would be a great fit for this next generation fighter, and I remain confident in our chances."
4843,repmacthornberry,Republican,"Today, the House passed the PRIVATE Act to protect troops from nonconsensual sharing of intimate images by other military members. I continue to be disturbed by deplorable acts that degrade our service members.  I am encouraged, however, that the House took swift and significant action to begin addressing the issue by strengthening the UCMJ to ensure that personnel are protected and that perpetrators are held appropriately accountable.  I credit Rep. McSally’s strong leadership in bringing Members together and in getting action quickly on this measure."

As veterans, we have a unique shared experience, and as a result, we know how to look out for ourselves, each other, and what warning signs to look for.

4865,RepAnthonyBrown,Democrat,"For over 80 years, #silencers have been effectively regulated under the #NationalFirearmsAct. Plain and simple, the current law is working and crimes involving silencers are rare. Congressional Republicans are pushing the so-called #HearingProtectionAct to not only remove the requirement that silencers be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), but also requires the ATF destroy the existing registry altogether. It limits the ability of states to impose taxes on silencers, and enables these dangerous devises to find their way into the wrong hands.   If Congress is truly concerned about hearing loss from exposure to gunfire – for service members, veterans, police officers and hunters – let’s follow the advice of the National Hearing Conservation and invest in appropriately fitted hearing protection like earplugs and earmuffs."
4866,RepHensarling,Republican,My thoughts and prayers go out to all who were injured this morning. This senseless shooting is more than shocking – especially when it involves my friend and colleague Steve Scalise whom I work with daily.   God bless our brave Capitol Police men and women.

As the author of some of the nation's most important environmental laws, there could not be a more fitting tribute.

I've met so many people who aspire to own their own home one day - it's the American Dream - but Republicans are making it harder and harder. Why? To give billionaires and big corporations huge tax cuts
4900,reptrey,Republican,"Earlier this week, we won a victory for Hoosiers against the Washington establishment.

4902,repgaramendi,Democrat,"None of these made the headlines last week, but there were a lot of consequential votes before the House of Representatives. 1) Republicans in Congress voted to allow coal companies to pollute streams and rivers. 2) Shamefully, they also eliminated the requirement for oil companies to disclose payments to foreign government, making it a lot harder to understand conflicts of interest when oil company executives seek employment with the federal government. 3) The Republicans in Congress also voted to repeal a clean air law focused on reducing methane on public lands. 4) In a vote against American workers, the majority in Congress also voted to eliminate a rule requiring federal contractors to disclose their labor violations. I voted ""NO"" against all these bills.  Moving forward, I’ll give a weekly update explaining what’s happening in Congress.

The Trump Administration's actions tonight do not change the fact that discrimination is illegal. But they send a devastating message to our transgender students that their President does not find them worthy of equal protection. If President Trump wants to make good on his alleged support for the LGBTQ community, then he and his Attorney General must pledge to defend these critical protections at all costs."

4925,CongressmanRalphAbraham,Republican,"Whether it's new sanctions on Iran for their ballistic missile testing or honest, frank discussions with our allies about problems like immigration, I like what I see from President Trump. I think the reason some people are uncomfortable with the pace and tone of the new administration is because they've grown accustomed over the last eight years to an administration that draws red lines it never intends to enforce. The only way to show the world we aren't a paper tiger is to lead with strength, and that's exactly what our president is doing."

4949,senatormikelee,Republican,"The people of San Juan County understand that the #BearsEars National Monument will be devastating to their community. They’ve seen their worst nightmares become reality in other Utah counties as a result of a presidential national-monument designation. That’s why on December 29, the day after President Obama announced the Bears Ears monument, a crowd of several hundred Utahns assembled to hold a protest on the steps of the San Juan County courthouse.   Braving the frigid weather, they gathered together to demonstrate that they – the individuals and families who will be directly affected by a Bears Ears national monument – believe the president has no business seizing vast stretches of public lands to be micromanaged, and mismanaged, by federal agencies.   But the protestors weren’t just angry. They were resolute, confident about the future, and determined to keep fighting for their right to participate in the management of the land in their community.   Of course, environmentalists and national-monument advocates want the people of San Juan County to believe that the fight is over and that they lost. In their view, President Obama’s proclamation of the Bears Ears National Monument is permanent, irreversible, carved in stone. As one White House official recently told The Washington Post, “We do not see that the Trump administration has authority to undo this.”  But Madam President, that’s because they’re not looking hard enough.   The truth is, what can be done through unilateral executive action can also be undone the same way. Such is the impermanence of executive power in our constitutional republic, where major policy changes require broad consensus, forged through legislative compromise, to endure the test of time."

From combating the opioid crisis, to assisting veterans and military families, to helping communities recover from natural disasters, national service members work locally and across Indian Country to tackle pressing challenges. It's unthinkable that President Trump would completely cut funding for this important program. National service programs work.

Jeff’s twenty years of experience in the Senate only adds to his resume. As the Senior Senator from Alabama, he has championed bi-partisan legislation, worked on behalf of low-income and mostly African-American women who did not have easily accessible health care, protected victims of child abuse, worked to curb crime and reform the criminal justice system, and help the families of our fallen military men and women.

Projects like the new composite recycling center in Port Angeles that is an advanced manufacturing hub or the redevelopment of downtown Bremerton. What some folks might not know is that both of these initiatives were successful in part because the federal government partnered with local leaders. The U.S. Economic Development Administration within the U.S. Department of Commerce successfully provides grants for projects like these in our community. The President’s budget proposal would have eliminated the Economic Development Administration. That’s not right. I want the government to continue investing in jobs.

Of course, the president’s action is just part of what must be a larger and broader national effort.

The delegation visited Jacksonville and Miami and took an aerial tour of the Florida Keys before visiting the Houston metropolitan area to assess Hurricane Irma and Harvey recovery efforts in order to ensure that funding is readily available to meet the needs of the victims of these disasters.  “These were distinctly different storms but they both shattered the lives of many of our fellow Americans.  Homes are destroyed.  Businesses are heavily damaged.  The power remains out in many areas.  The Florida Keys are particularly devastated,” said Frelinghuysen.  “The hundreds of thousands of victims of these destructive storms are still in the early stages of what will be a long and difficult recovery from Harvey and Irma, and now, Maria in Puerto Rico. We will work together to make sure that the necessary federal resources are in place for the rebuilding. We will be there every step of the way.”  The delegation received multiple briefings in Florida and Houston from federal, state, and local officials including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).    Frelinghuysen’s Appropriations Committee plays a central role in ensuring that the federal government provides the help the victims need.  “It was important for me to be on the ground to listen and learn and to reassure residents and local officials that that we will help them rebuild.    This month, the Congress quickly passed a bipartisan bill that Frelinghuysen developed to replenish funds in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund and the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.  “I also appreciated the opportunity to thank personally the first responders and the military members who risked their own safety to rescue so many victims.

5052,rfrelinghuysen,Republican,"Frelinghuysen’s Continuing Appropriations Package Addresses New Jersey Needs  WASHINGTON D.C. – The “Continuing Appropriations” package introduced by House Appropriations Chairman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, expected to be approved by Congress by a bipartisan majority and signed by the President this week, contains funding important to New Jersey.   “This package of the remaining Appropriations bills is the result of over a year’s worth of careful and dedicated efforts to closely examine federal programs to make the best possible use of every tax dollar,” said Frelinghuysen.  “This legislation will fund critical federal government activities, including our national defense, and enact responsible funding decisions to target U.S. investments where they are needed the most, including many in New Jersey. It also maintains and enhances policies that bolster economic growth and support the core values that our nation is built upon.”  Details of the entire appropriations package can be found here:  http://appropriations.house.gov/news/documentquery.aspx?DocumentTypeID=2151&CatagoryID=34778  To summarize just a few New Jersey priorities:   Amtrak Northeast Corridor/Gateway  The Transportation-Housing and Urban Development (T-HUD) title of the bill adds $75 million for Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor for a total of $328 million.  The bill’s intent is that Amtrak will use a significant share of the additional funding to address issues related to the Gateway project.  Specifically, the Statement of Managers” states: “The agreement allows Amtrak to undertake new capital projects and encourages Amtrak to prioritize strategic rail infrastructure improvements at critical points in the rail network that would improve current services or create new capacity.”  Highlands Open Space/Drinking Water Protection    The Interior title of the package contains $10 million for land conservation partnership projects and open space purchases from willing sellers in the four-state Highlands region: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut, a critical watershed region which provides drinking water for millions.      Homeland Security Non-Profit Security Grants  The Homeland Security title of the Continuing Appropriations bill includes $605 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and $25 million to be designated for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) which supports “target hardening” and other physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations that are at high risk of terrorist attack.  In the wake of a recent wave of anti-Semitic threats against synagogues and Jewish schools, the total funding for the NSGP is $5 million higher than current levels.  Urban Search and Rescue  The Homeland Security title provides $38.2 million for FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue system (USAR) and included is a “one-time increase” of $3.1 million from the current budget levels “to ensure teams are uniformly equipped.” New Jersey Task Force 1 is the newest member of the USAR, having joined less than one year ago.     HUD-VASH Homeless Vouchers  The T-HUD title contains $40 million above President Obama’s last budget request for 3,700 new vouchers for housing for homeless veterans under the HUD-VASH program.  The FY 2017 Military Construction-VA appropriations bill, passed last year, provided funding for 79,000 veterans.    Housing Vouchers for People with Disabilities (Frelinghuysen Vouchers)  Under the T-HUD title, the final bill includes $120 million for Section 811 vouchers for persons with disabilities – the “Frelinghuysen Vouchers” – $10 million above President Obama’s FY 2017 budget request to provide new housing opportunities for persons with disabilities.  Defense  The Department of Defense (DOD) portion of the Omnibus funds critical national security needs, including military operations and readiness programs, as well as health and quality-of-life programs for our troops and military families. In total, the bill provides $593 billion, an increase of $19.9 billion over the fiscal year 2016 enacted level and $16.3 billion more than the Obama Administration’s request.   When combined with the $5.8 billion in supplemental funding enacted in the Continuing Resolution that passed in December, the total Defense funding for fiscal year 2017 is $598.5 billion, an increase of $25.7 billion over fiscal year 2016 and $22.1 billion more than President Obama’s original request.  The DOD portion of the legislative package contains significant new money to fund critical efforts by the Armaments Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny Arsenal to increase the range, lethality, and survivability of U.S. military units on the battlefield.   In addition, the measure provides funding for the planning and design, in FY 2017, of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Research and Development Center at Picatinny Arsenal in FY 2019.   In addition to providing base operating funds for all of New Jersey’s military installations including Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Naval Weapons Station Earle and the 177th Fighter Wing in Atlantic City, the bill includes funding that will increase New Jersey’s military contributions.  Protecting the strength and sustainability of this state’s unique military installations is critical to all of our Armed Forces.  Supporting these bases is vital to both our national defense and our state’s historical support for national security.

5053,SenatorSasse,Republican,"Focused my opening remarks at the confirmation hearing of Judge Neil Gorsuch around a simple image: a judge’s black robe. It’s a strange thing that judges wear robes. But instead of looking past this strange convention, let’s look right at it. For it isn’t just some relic from the past. It isn’t just something people wore long ago in a forgotten era of formality, like a powdered wig.   So why do the robes – often unfashionable and unflattering – persist? The reasons were summed up better than I could put it by one sitting judge. He said:  “[D]onning a robe doesn’t make me any smarter. But the robe does mean something – and not just that I can hide coffee stains on my shirt. It serves as a reminder of what’s expected of us – what Burke called the ‘cold neutrality of an impartial judge.’ It serves, too, as a reminder of the relatively modest station we’re meant to occupy in a democratic society. In other places, judges wear scarlet.... Here, we’re told to buy our own plain black robes – and I can attest the standard choir outfit at the local uniform supply store is a good deal. Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester.”  The author of these insightful words was Judge Neil Gorsuch. And that statement is an excellent lens through which to frame the work of this Committee this week – and indeed the work of the Supreme Court for the next century and beyond.   I want to make three simple, overlapping points about the judge’s black robe:   One, it changes the way our eyes see the Court;   Two, it reiterates the duty – the calling – of a judge to the judge; and   Three, it gives us an opportunity to teach our kids about our – their – Constitution, our fundamental law, the enduring paper that defines what our government can and cannot do.   Watch the full speech to flesh out all three of these points – but here’s the big takeaway: Today, Judge Gorsuch is wearing a suit and tie. Before he can put on that black robe he must answer the committee’s questions. I expect that Mr. Gorsuch, the citizen, has policy preferences and desired outcomes. I also expect that by the end of this week it will be clear that Judge Gorsuch, the judge’s judge, will faithfully embody the spirit of that black robe."

The story of their generosity has since gone viral, drawing admirers across the country and even some celebrities—including the Ellen DeGeneres.    As Mr. Oroke previously told The Baltimore Sun, “It’s oftentimes striking how we see those who have the least give the most. I think it’s because they’ve seen that side of things, and have stronger empathy.” You’ve got to watch and read this inspiring story about Mr. Oroke and students from City Springs Middle School."

This is the same legal tool that allowed an alleged culture of sexual harassment to run rampant at Jared and Kay Jewelers.  Mandatory arbitration prevents sexual harassment cases from being public. It silences victims and keeps their stories confidential. My bill will help end the “Mad Men” culture that has no place in America in 2017. #MeToo"

5063,SenDuckworth,Democrat,"I relied on Pell Grants, student loans and a part-time waitressing job to pay for college, so I know how important making college more affordable can be. I’m glad I had the opportunity to chat with University of Chicago President Bob Zimmer about how we can work together to help make affordable higher education a reality for all Americans by expanding Pell Grants and allowing borrowers to refinance their student loans at lower rates."
5064,WhipHoyer,Democrat,"Under pressure from a President who doesn’t understand how Congress works, Senate Republicans are now including in their tax bill a provision to eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate.  This, effectively, would collapse our health insurance markets, spike premiums, and lead to 13 million more Americans uninsured – all in the name of finding additional offsets to pay for tax cuts to the wealthiest few.  Republicans have already failed to dismantle the Affordable Care Act twice; apparently they believe making the same mistake a third time will yield a different outcome.  I suspect they will quickly discover that is not the case. http://bit.ly/2hAIO7j"

5066,RepLaMalfa,Republican,"Today, the House is voting on the Thin Blue Line Act, which adds the murder of a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or first responder as an aggravated factor for a jury to consider in deciding whether to impose the death penalty in federal capital cases. 135 officers were killed in the line of duty last year, 11 of which were from California – including Modoc County Sheriff’s Department’s own Jack Hopkins. This bill sends a clear message that the murder of a police officer will not be tolerated and that justice will be served. I spoke on the House floor in support of this bill and National Police Week."

5074,RepTulsiGabbard,Democrat,"The latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act – the #GrahamCassidy bill – strips funds for Medicaid, decreases access to affordable coverage, increases out-of-pocket costs, threatens coverage of essential health benefits, and undermines protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The Graham-Cassidy bill is just as bad, if not worse, than prior repeal measures we’ve seen. Rather than providing real solutions to our healthcare crisis, the Graham-Cassidy bill punts the problem to states and gives them less funding and fewer resources to provide care for their residents, ultimately hurting our most vulnerable populations. In addition, the Senate is irresponsibly rushing this bill through the chamber before their self-imposed September 30th deadline. Although Senator John McCain has announced his opposition to the bill, we must continue to speak out in strong opposition to the Graham-Cassidy bill as there are still Senators who are on the fence. We must focus on providing real solutions to fix our healthcare system. We must ensure that all Americans have quality, affordable healthcare by passing H.R. 676, the Medicare for All Act."

It’s a time to raise awareness about preventive measures that folks can take to catch cancer early. It’s also a time for survivors to thank those who supported us during our fight. Breast Cancer Awareness Month is also an important time to thank and show appreciation for the work organizations like North Dakota Cancer Coalition do year round to support families, stress the importance of prevention, and help make our world cancer-free in this lifetime. I’m so grateful to all of the folks who dedicate their lives to this cause. So this month – and every month – lets thank the committed professionals and advocates, support those who are currently battling cancer, remember those we lost to this heartbreaking disease, and raise up the survivors who have been put through the ringer."

5086,RepByrne,Republican,"I got a little fired up on the House floor today while speaking in support of a resolution to condemn the Obama Administration for abstaining from a recent United Nations (UN) vote relating to Israel. In other words, the United States turned our back and looked the other way as the UN passed a flawed resolution attacking Israel. By abstaining and allowing this resolution to pass, the Obama Administration has upset decades of bipartisan policy as it relates to Israel and put a pathway to peace between Israel and the Palestinian Authority even further out of reach. I think supporting Israel is a cause worth fighting for, and I was pleased to see over 340 of my colleagues joining me in a strong bipartisan vote in support of Israel."

Choice was scheduled to end on August 7, but President Trump signed The Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act on Wednesday extending the program until early 2018. Veterans will no longer be responsible for paying the private provider. The new law makes the Veterans Administration the primary payer. The Act also makes record-sharing between the VA and outside doctors easier. The Veterans Choice program has already expanded access to care for veterans. Now, the extension gives Congress time to work on more ways to allow veterans to get the help they need outside of the VA system. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House Veterans Affairs Committee to ensure more choice for veterans, especially those in the Marianas."

5121,SenatorTomCotton,Republican,"These revelations are another example of how the Obama administration coddled the Putin regime for eight years. Indeed, a senior official called me after the election-after the administration had rebuked Russia for meddling in the campaign-and asked me to withdraw my provision to enforce the rules on ‘diplomatic' travel. It's also giving the Russians too much credit to say they broke the rules of espionage-because it's clear they had no intention of following them in the first place. I'm glad Congress had the good sense to hold our ground on enforcing the rules on Russian diplomats' travel within our country. This story is a vindication of sorts, though a disturbing one, and it's yet another reminder of the need for the State Department to enforce these rules aggressively."

5183,SenJackReed,Democrat,"President Trump’s intolerant and misguided executive order on refugees runs counter to America’s interests and values.  A thorough vetting system developed since 9/11 is already in place and refugees are among the most heavily scrutinized of all people who enter our country.  This amounts to a new religious test.  It is wrong, ‎unconstitutional, and will do nothing to keep us safe.   In order to defeat ISIL, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups, we need cooperation from the Muslim world.  President Trump’s irresponsible action hurts our alliances and undermines our security.   The people targeted by this unnecessary action are fleeing the same violent extremists who would seek to disrupt our way of life.  These are people who look to the United States to offer a safe harbor, people who, in many cases, put their lives on the line in support of American military objectives.  Turning our backs on those in need is not the American way.   If President Trump’s plan becomes standard U.S. policy, it will be a blow to all Americans.  Many Republicans repudiated this kind of thing last fall and now they are standing by in complicit silence.  Regardless of one’s political party, it is time to keep faith with the Constitution and reject this religious ban before it spreads.‎‎"

I think it’s important that we not lower the bar on what we believe simply because a Republican is now in the White House. We have a repeal bill that was fully supported by House and Senate Republicans and made its way to President Obama’s desk last January. As Republicans, we decried the fact that he would veto it. Why would we now water down this same bill and send a new and weaker bill to President Trump?   With regard to a healthcare bill moving forward, I see leadership’s healthcare plan as an opening proposal. In as much as President Donald J. Trump views many things as a negotiation, I’m quite sure he would rarely take any party’s opening bid. The debate that is forming will allow conservatives to enhance and improve what has been proposed, and I think this could represent a win for patients, healthcare providers, and the taxpayer alike.

I was once a young immigrant to this nation, which has since given me the opportunity to work hard, raise my family, and serve my country both in the military and in Congress. Terminating DACA and stripping DREAMers of that hope and opportunity is unconscionable and incompatible with our American values.   We cannot afford to abandon DACA recipients, who have lived in America all their lives and contribute to this country in many ways. Ending this program undermines our economic growth and competitiveness, costing our economy $490 billion in lost GDP over the next decade in addition to losing potential innovation and entrepreneurship.  Congress must take immediate action to protect DREAMers before the program is set to expire.

While I cannot change the past, I can demonstrate to you – through my actions – that I am listening and fighting. For over five years, I have refused to accept contributions from the NRA, and while I have not chosen to return previous donations, I have instead chosen to donate those funds to local and national organizations fighting for common sense gun safety policies.

Throughout this process, President Trump has disregarded the recommendations of his own Cabinet members that he re-certify the deal.  Allowing Iran to advance its nuclear weapons program without recourse or inspection would be an unacceptable, direct threat to Israel’s lasting safety and security. Fortunately, the President’s decertification of the agreement does not constitute withdrawal, and it is now up to Congress to uphold our global commitments and work with our international partners to enforce the deal vigorously.

Now, Jeff Sessions is enacting a policy that will send more people to jail for longer. This is good for private prison operators, but bad for communities and our country as a whole.

5250,RepSeanMaloney,Democrat,This plan is bad for nearly everyone in the Hudson Valley. Middle class families would end up paying more in taxes. Eliminating local and state deductions is a non-starter – simple as that.

5254,herrerabeutler,Republican,"Whenever I attend a presidential speech to Congress, I look first for areas of common ground where we can work together to improve conditions for the people I serve in Southwest Washington.  Tonight was no exception and I look forward to working with President Trump to truly improve health care in this country for everyone – including protecting access for those who currently have coverage, and those with pre-existing conditions.  Where Obamacare has failed, we need health care solutions that will actually make quality health care affordable and accessible for everyone.  I was also encouraged by the president's championing of efforts to make the workplace better for parents and to protect good jobs and create better-paying ones by strengthening opportunities for small businesses.  And I stand ready to partner with him on rebuilding our infrastructure to get our economy moving again. After tonight's speech, I see a number of areas we can cooperate and make life better for Southwest Washington residents, and I’m ready to get to work."
5255,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"Many thanks to Lt. Colonel Adam Czekanski, District Commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District, for visiting Monroe County today.

NYS Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Services delivered 50,000 sandbags to Monroe County this week and 100,000 more are stockpiled locally. Please stay safe out there. For the latest information and assistance, call the Lake Ontario Flood Assistance Hotline at (866) 244-3839."
5256,boblatta,Republican,"Small businesses are the engines of our economy and are essential to our local economies. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the country’s leading advocate for small businesses, is supporting our legislation in Congress that would provide needed tax relief and tax code simplicity for Main Street employers. Make sure to read the NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan on why our bill will help small businesses in Ohio and around the country."
5257,RepAndyBarr,Republican,"Earlier this week, I voted in favor of a $7.85 billion targeted package to support relief and recovery efforts in response to Hurricane Harvey.  That bill, which was an appropriate emergency response to the disaster in Texas and Louisiana, passed nearly unanimously in the House and should have been quickly approved by the Senate and sent to the President without political games.  Unfortunately, that non-controversial legislation was modified to include non-emergency spending, raise the debt limit, and reauthorize the bankrupt national flood insurance program without reforms. I voted no.   It is unfair to young and future generations of Americans to raise the debt ceiling without enacting any reforms that would address the nation's spending addiction.  The national debt has doubled over the past decade and I did not run for Congress to treat the debt limit as a mere speed bump along the road to national bankruptcy.  It is particularly disturbing that this deal was sold as hurricane disaster relief but does absolutely nothing to reform our bankrupt National Flood Insurance Program which, before these hurricanes, was $25 billion in debt, is actuarially unsound, will soon require another taxpayer bailout and incentivizes people to build and live in harm’s way.  I strongly support providing targeted, paid-for and fiscally responsible disaster relief, and I voted to do so earlier this week.  I also recognize the need to raise debt limit and honor the obligations of the United States.  But simply blowing through the debt ceiling and kicking the can down the road with literally no offsets or fiscal reforms is exactly why our nation is rapidly approaching a debt crisis."
5258,SenCoryGardner,Republican,"I asked Nikki Haley about the lack of U.S. leadership at the United Nations at today’s confirmation hearing. While members of the UN applauded the condemnation of our friend and ally Israel, they sat there silently after sanctioning North Korea, the world’s leading human rights violator. The U.S. cannot afford to abandon our allies and must lead the fight for a stronger, safer global community."

Its actions, continuing to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, will inevitably force premiums to skyrocket, hurting consumers.  The White House assured me just last week that cost sharing reduction payments would continue to be made, and the American people fully expect the President to uphold his commitment. http://bit.ly/2qvoeEK"

5339,CongressmanGarretGraves,Republican,"UPDATE: just getting a chance to see comments here and it is pretty clear that I did an awful job communicating.  Going to try again:  1) Puerto Rico was badly damaged and food/water supplies are badly needed.  2) Today, the Dept of Homeland Security waived the Jones Act (allows for foreign vessels to travel to two or more points in the U.S.).  The reason they did this is because there was a belief that cargo could not get TO the island.   3) At a hearing this morning, it became very clear that getting cargo to Puerto Rico's port facilities was not the problem.  Rather, the issue is actually distributing the food/water/supplies FROM Puerto Rico's port to the disaster victims.  The trucks, roads, bridges and other transportation systems on the island are damaged so they are having trouble getting out of the port.  Several thousand shipping containers are in Puerto Rico now full of relief supplies. 4) The point was that the federal government had better not sit back and do nothing now that the Jones Act has been waived because this will not solve the problem of getting relief supplies to those in need.  More needs to be done.  5) FEMA, DHS, our military and others need to use aircraft to get supplies to disaster victims.  We also need to be working to restore infrastructure like roads and bridges as quickly as possible.    Hope that helps. ###  As was made clear at this morning's hearing, this is a solution in search of a problem. There are several thousand shipping containers sitting at the docks in PR today. The problem isn't the Jones Act. The problem is that there was a hurricane. Logistical systems are destroyed. Trucks, highways and other transportation systems are gone. They can't get food and supplies to hurrucane victims. Already, two-thirds of the commerce arriving in Puerto Rico arrives on foreign vessels.   Anyone that thinks this waiver just solved the problem is confused. I'd argue that it just did more harm than good. We have a huge shipping industry on the Gulf Coast that needs the jobs and economic activity now to help economies recover from their disasters. You just took American jobs and sent them overseas.   The governor of PR needs to focus on real recovery for the island and stop asking for unicorns.  http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2017/09/white_house_waives_jones_act_t.html"

I voted NO, as did every other Democratic member.   This ill-considered and partisan bill does nothing to help the average American, but instead dismantles important pieces of Dodd-Frank, all to enrich Wall Street at the expense of consumers.

We have an incredible opportunity to reform the way Washington works, rebuild our military, and secure our borders. Most importantly, we will work with President Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare. Millions of Americans have been hurt by Obamacare: their premiums and deductibles have skyrocketed, their plans were canceled, and their previous doctors can no longer see them.

I know that access to affordable care is a challenge for so many. I hear from fishermen who can’t afford the coverage that they have, small business owners who can’t afford insurance at all, and those who have gained coverage for the first time in their life. These Alaskans have shared their anxiety that their personal situation may be made worse under the legislation considered this week. As a Senate, as leaders, we have an obligation to do better for those whom we serve. I stand ready to begin work with my colleagues – all of them – to reform healthcare in a more open process."

5421,SenatorDurbin,Democrat,"Today on the Senate floor, I denounced House Republicans for turning their backs on Americans with pre-existing conditions in their plan to repeal health care. Under Trumpcare, insurance companies would once again be allowed to impose pre-existing condition penalties on people if a state receives a “waiver”, even though Republicans continue to deny this simple fact. It was just a little over a week ago when I became a statistic, not just a Senator but a statistic in health care. I am an American with a pre-existing condition. The Affordable Care Act says that just because you have a pre-existing condition – and one out of three Americans have one – you can’t be denied coverage or charged more. Trumpcare would be a major step backwards."

The result is that victims of domestic violence are held captive emotionally while their beloved pets are used as pawns to prolong an abusive relationship. We must make it possible for women to break free knowing that their pets will be able to move with them wherever they go. I applaud those shelters and programs that have already worked to accommodate pets, and I will continue pushing with my colleagues for a nationwide standard."

The bill discriminates against people with pre-existing conditions (asthma, cancer, diabetes, pregnant women, hypertension, etc.) and will result in outrageously high premiums that many will simply not be able to afford."

5456,congressmanjohndelaney,Democrat,"For each day of #BlackHistoryMonth we're highlighting a history-maker from Maryland. Today's entry is Frederick Douglass, who has made his way into the news recently. Douglass was born a slave in 1818 in Talbot County. Douglass learned to read and write at a young age, teaching other slaves to do the same. Douglass often said, “Knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom.” Douglass met Anne Murray, a free woman, in 1837. She motivated him to escape slavery in 1838, eventually taking a train north to freedom. After gaining his freedom, Douglass began to read The Liberator, a weekly journal written by William Lloyd Garrison. The Liberator inspired Douglass to get more involved in the abolitionist movement. He gave impassioned speeches across the country, detailing his life story and rousing many Americans to take action. In 1845, Douglass published one of his most widely read and influential works, “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.” His autobiography immediately became a bestseller, capturing the brutality of slavery in America. Douglass began publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, The North Star, with the motto “Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren.” Douglass not only fought for emancipation, but for women’s suffrage. He attended the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, where he was a major influence passing a resolution asking for women’s suffrage. Douglass continued to fight for civil rights and suffrage throughout the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. By the time of his death in 1895, Douglass was known around the world as a champion for justice, freedom, and equality."

Unfortunately, the Trump Administration is attempting to curtail all the progress we’ve made by cutting $295 million from programs that support Alzheimer’s disease research in its 2018 budget request.

It’s unfair to expect a small-town family business to pay their fair share while billions of dollars remain unaccounted for from multinational giants. We want our tax priorities to invest in the middle class and working families while holding the top earners accountable for their contribution to the country.   The Congressional Progressive Caucus believes that all Americans deserve a shot at success, not a rigged economy favoring the wealthy. Rather than give corporations and the top 1% a windfall, we should increase transparency, demand accountability, and, most important of all, invest in our people.  Special interests and some of the wealthiest in our country are supporting the GOP to create a plan that will change very little for working families. With 80% of all proposed tax cuts benefiting only the top 1% of the country, it’s time to call this plan what it is: a GOP giveaway."

While health insurance rates are guaranteed to continue rising under Obamacare, allowing greater patient choice in purchasing plans will help ease the pain. It’s the wisdom of the marketplace: more freedom and more competition leads to lower prices and better quality. That’s why I support fully repealing Obamacare. I will continue advocating for that, while also supporting the president on intermediate-steps like today’s directive."

5530,RepRubenGallego,Democrat,"Jeff Sessions has a long and troubling history of racial animosity and hostility towards civil rights, and in his short time on the job, he’s already aligning DOJ policy with those dangerous views.  He made it crystal clear that he has no intention of holding police accountable when he indicated the Justice Department would walk back its monitoring of local law enforcement agencies that have been charged with civil rights abuses.  Under Jeff Sessions’ watch, we can expect a return to unjust targeting of minority communities.   The American people deserve a Justice Department that will fight to protect the civil rights of all people and take strong action against those who threaten them. We must demand more of our nation’s top law enforcement official."
5531,SenatorLankford,Republican,"HEALTHCARE UPDATE: As I mentioned in yesterday’s video, the Senate started an open debate and amendment process to repeal and replace Obamacare on Tuesday. Late last night, the Senate voted on its first amendment - an updated version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) that included Sen. Ted Cruz’ Consumer Freedom Option legislation (which allows insurance companies to offer very simple, cheap plans) and Sen. Rob Portman’s $100 billion stability fund to help low-income Americans have more insurance choices. I voted for the amendment, but it failed by a vote of 43-57. Below is a link to read more information on the BCRA.   Later this afternoon, we will vote on another amendment that would repeal Obamacare with a two-year implementation delay for Congress to pass reforms or craft replacement legislation. This amendment is similar to the 2015 repeal bill that President Obama vetoed. Within the next few days there will be many, many more amendments offered by both Republicans and Democrats. You can watch the Senate floor on C-SPAN2 or stay tuned here for more updates.   https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-lankford-statement-on-revised-senate-healthcare-bill"

Under the Obama Administration, the government engaged in a “pay and chase” method whereby, according to a report by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, more than $700 million in ObamaCare subsidies were paid to illegal aliens.

5541,RepBarbaraLee,Democrat,"The Affordable Care Act is under attack once again, and we only have a few days to save it. Senate Republicans are making a last ditch effort to repeal the ACA with a bill that would take healthcare from millions, skyrocket costs for people with pre-existing conditions, impose an “age tax” on the elderly and end Medicaid as we know it. In my own community -- California’s 13th Congressional District -- more than 21,000 children would lose health insurance. This is unacceptable and shameful.  Doctors take a pledge to “first, do no harm.” As Members of Congress, we too are entrusted with the health and safety of our constituents.

This industry provides a low-cost, reliable source of energy to the tune of over 18 billion dollars in economic impact and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. Working to hamper this industry is nothing but petty vindictiveness from extreme, left-wing environmentalists operating in an unrealistic fantasy land. Having played a leadership role in fighting the so-called “Stream Protection Rule” for many years,  I have introduced a bill disapproving of the latest submission from the Department of the Interior. The American people have spoken and it is time to let the unified Republican government led by President Trump set a course for a new American energy revolution that will lower costs and grow our economy across the board."

First, I offered an amendment that would have prevented the inhumane slaughter of wild horses that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is rounding up.  Wild horses are an important part of our Colorado heritage, capturing the public imagination and inspiring people for generations to come. Ending the mistreatment and slaughtering of these animals aligns with our moral values, saves taxpayer dollars, and preserves Colorado's precious heritage.  I also offered an amendment that would remove harmful language that blocked the protection of wolves and sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act.  My amendment, had it passed, would have re-established the wolf and sage grouse populations back to healthy levels.  Moments ago, Republicans rejected my amendments on a party line vote, but I will continue to be a leading voice for all vital and precious animals."

Letting the States get rid of the Essential Health Benefits - the 10 basic medical care categories plans have to cover, like emergency care, mental health and addiction treatment, and lab tests - is just crazy.

5604,RepAndyBarr,Republican,"Today is a great day for freedom in America. I was proud to vote in favor of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act, legislation that will repeal most of Obamacare’s mandates, taxes, and regulations while making important reforms that will lower costs and expand access to care.  After seven years of broken promises, lost coverage, skyrocketing premiums, thousands of pages of regulations, tax penalties, collapsing co-ops, fewer jobs, and state exchanges which are now in a death spiral of fewer choices and rising costs – the House of Representatives has taken a critical step in the process that will finally repeal and replace Obamacare.  And we have done so in a way that provides multiple layers of protections for people with pre-existing conditions.  Since I first ran for Congress, I promised the people of the Sixth District that I would vote to repeal this broken law and replace it with reforms that will actually lower costs and expand access to care through patient-centered, market-based reforms.    The American Health Care Act accomplishes these goals and more.  It delivers the most important reforms to an entitlement program in American history, it cuts taxes by nearly $1 trillion, it protects life and redirects funds from Planned Parenthood to Community Health Centers, and it returns power from the federal government to the states and the people."

5633,WhipHoyer,Democrat,"President Trump promised the American people that under the Republican health care plan, there would be “insurance for everybody” that is “much less expensive and much better.” But the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office’s report shows 24 million Americans would lose coverage and millions more would #PayMoreForLess. While GOP leaders try to spin the CBO score or discredit it outright, Republicans in the House and Senate are clearly concerned: http://bit.ly/2moLIZ0"
5634,RepDWS,Democrat,"Donald Trump is single-handedly sabotaging access to quality affordable health care coverage in America. His latest executive orders are designed to fracture insurance risk pools and cut subsidy payments, which threatens coverage for the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions and will raise premiums on middle-class Americans. It’s repugnant that any public official would specifically target sick and injured Americans by forcing them into substandard plans that offer inadequate coverage at invariably higher prices.   Congress and the American people have rejected Trumpcare. Yet the President insists on ignoring both to pursue a destructive policy path that will hurt millions of Americans financially, while inevitably inflicting physical harm on untold millions more. It’s a monstrous thing to do to the American people."
5635,RepRatcliffe,Republican,ICYMI: This week I joined The Mark Davis Show to discuss legislation we just passed in the House to repeal Obamacare and replace it with conservative health care reforms. I am so incredibly grateful that – for the first time ever – we have the opportunity to actually push this fight all the way across the finish line with a president who is willing to sign our legislation into law and say goodbye to the crumbling disaster of Obamacare forever. The American people have waited long enough.
5636,Rep.Grijalva,Democrat,"Barring people based on their nation of origin or the religion they practice isn’t just a policy change – it’s a tacit admission by our new president that he is incompetent to lead in ways his predecessors were not. And to be clear, the only difference between this Muslim ban and the last one – which was found unconstitutional by four federal judges – is the time Trump and his cronies spent scheming up a plan to get it past our legal system. Regardless of how successful they are at side-stepping the judicial branch’s rightful check on executive power, they cannot implement this ban without Congressional Republicans providing funding. It remains to be seen if the GOP will stand by our Constitution, our separation of church and state, and the international order that hinges on American leadership, or if they will vote to rubber stamp this president’s hateful agenda and wrecking ball diplomacy. I will fight this Muslim ban and every other corrosive policy Trump pursues that betrays who we are as a people and leaves our nation fundamentally less safe."

Last week, I introduced the Healthy Food Access for All Americans (HFAAA) Act to incentivize food providers to invest in communities where people lack access to nutritious, affordable food by establishing grocery stores, farmers markets and food banks in these areas.

5650,RepTedLieu,Democrat,"If there was still any doubt as to whether President Donald Trump had the temperament and positions to lead America as our Commander-in-Chief, let his first week in office be our answer. As a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee--and as an American--I am horrified at the behavior of the American President.  Trump has done silly, bizarre things that don't really matter, such as repeatedly lying to the American people about the crowd size at his relatively small inauguration. But he has also taken actions that deeply matter and harmed American interests, particularly in the area of foreign affairs. His go-it-alone approach is making America more isolated and increasing risks to our deployed personnel.

She’s a fighter; she’s survived breast cancer and lung cancer, and she’s been through surgery and chemo. Now Mom has Alzheimer’s, which is a daily struggle. But fortunately, she has been able to rely on Medicare, and so did my stepfather when he was diagnosed with cancer, right up until he passed away last year. Without Medicare, their medical needs would have brought significant stress to them and to the family. When some of my colleagues talk about cutting Medicare or Medicaid, I think about how cuts could send families into anxiety and financial ruin. So while Mom is fighting disease, I’ll be fighting to protect earned benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security."

While there is a lot more to do, in his short time he has already improved the access, quality and timeliness of the care the VA delivers.   Dr. Shulkin represents the best in public service and is an outstanding choice for VA secretary. His commitment to strengthen the VA; his opposition to privatization; his determination to fulfill every commitment this country has made to our veterans; and his ability to bring technology, resources, and  — most importantly:  accountability — to bear on the mission of the VA is exactly what our veterans need now.

5717,RepColleenHanabusa,Democrat,"I co-sponsored H.R. 3311, Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Act, which contained the following finding:  (6) The cost-sharing reduction payments in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provide stability in the individual health insurance market, lower insurance premiums by nearly 20 percent, and encourage competition among health insurers. The payments reduce costs for approximately 6,000,000 people with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty line by an average of about $1,100 per person and should be increased to help more Americans.""  According to the article below:  ""The White House confirmed late Thursday that it would halt federal payments for cost-sharing reductions, although a statement did not specify when. According to two people briefed on the decision, the cutoff will be as of November. The subsidies total about $7 billion this year.""  While President Trump has threatened for some time to cut off cost-sharing subsidies and let Obamacare ""implode,"" administration officials ""warned him that such a move would cause an implosion of the ACA marketplaces that could be blamed on Republicans.""  Nevertheless, as reported by The Washington Post (and other papers), President Trump will apparently move to end the cost-sharing subsidies before the end of the year."

5723,SenatorDavidPerdue,Republican,"We finally have a president who has the guts to choose American workers over special interests. Energy projects like the Keystone Pipeline will generate jobs and inject new life into our economy. For years, we’ve had our hands tied by a Democratic Administration unwilling to unleash our full energy potential, even after its own environmental assessments returned favorable reviews. Last Congress, President Obama vetoed the Keystone Pipeline, after Congress approved the project with a bipartisan majority in both chambers. President Trump is already translating his rhetoric into results, and I look forward to working together to make our country more energy independent."

I was so proud to bring this bill to the floor as Chairwoman of the Rules Committee in 2009 and I stand by what I said on that day: a woman should not be paid less because she’s a woman. Even though this landmark law helped pave the way for equal pay, women still face discrimination in the workplace. On average, women who work full time earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Even worse, African American women earn only 64 cents and Latinas earned only 56 cents for each dollar earned by a white man. I have always been a proud advocate for equal pay and you can count on me to continue fighting for this important cause!"

Some important points come out of this:  - We need much greater federal support for America's drinking water systems - Small and rural community water systems fail and local governments don't have the money to fix them  - Many systems have pipes installed more than a century ago. There are pipes in the NY Capital Region that were installed during the Rutherford B. Hayes Administration - Maintaining and upgrading are as as little as 1/10th as expensive as doing repairs after systems fail - System failures force businesses to shut down, hurting wages and small business bottom lines - 19 million people get sick every year from inadequately maintained water systems in the U.S - Lead contamination is widespread, and around 4 million people are served water that exceeds federal action limits on lead"

So the next generation will be better off because of inventors as long as politicians don’t screw it up.”  “There is a certain critical size companies reach before they hire lobbyists, which means only the big companies are represented on Capitol Hill,”   “They are here in Congress looking to weaken patents and they are not just interested in weakening patents issued in the future, they are looking to weaken all patents.”  “Patents help the little guy, whether you are a one person company or a company with 10,000 employees, you have the same rights. That is repulsive to the company with 10,000 employees.”  “I’m often amused at some of the academics that talk about intellectual property,” Massie said. “They talk about inventions happening with the same vigor even if inventors are not compensated with a patent, and that notion is ridiculous. You have to make a living somehow.

Since 1965 we have made great strides to ensure more and more students have access to these opportunities, but it is time to shift our focus. Our students currently face a higher education system plagued with skyrocketing costs and a student debt crisis that saw 580,000 student borrowers default on their loans in the last year alone.   The PROSPER Act introduced in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce today would hold failing institutions and programs accountable while giving successful institutions the ability to reverse rising costs and empower students to make informed decisions about their own education. We must give our students the opportunity to prosper, and this bill will set them up for success."

5785,repstephenlynch,Democrat,"Today, I sent a letter, alongside Congressman Peter Welch of Vermont, calling on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to hold a bipartisan hearing to examine the long-term strategies of the Trump Administration in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the Trump Administration weighs expanding military capabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is vital that the Oversight Committee evaluate the soundness of these proposals. With American servicemen and women being sent on to the battlefield overseas, it is critical that the Trump Administration is held accountable for a long-term strategy.  The lack of transparency from the Trump Administration regarding their overall plan hinders Congress’ ability to determine whether deploying thousands of American troops is consistent with the original Authorization for the Use of Military Force granted 14 years ago. I think that initiating a major effort like this would require the Trump Administration to come back to Congress and explain its strategy and request a further authorization for that purpose consistent with the War Powers Act.

5790,RepLowenthal,Democrat,"While the exact impacts remain to be seen, health care experts are saying that President Trump’s executive order to try to work around the law set by Obamacare will not provide better care and will not lower premiums for Americans. This attempt to circumvent the Affordable Care Act is illegal, will result in more expensive health coverage for many, will open the door for insurance companies to charge more for people with preexisting conditions, and allow these plans not to provide essential benefits such as maternity care or mental health coverage. Expanding the scope of association health plans to allow them to work across multiple states and provide lower level benefits could take employed, young, healthy people out of the private insurance market, which would result in a steep increase in premiums, pricing the Americans most in need of affordable health coverage out of the market. Analyses by the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute agrees that this attempted work around by the administration is illegal and will likely not stand up in court."
5791,johnmccain,Republican,"We’re working hard to fully reform the VA and give our veterans the best quality care they have earned and deserve. Today, the President took an important first step in that effort by signing our legislation to extend the Veterans Choice Program – ensuring veterans won’t have to face unreasonable wait-times for appointments or drive long distances to get the care they need.  In Phoenix, we launched a new collaboration between CVS and the VA that allows Phoenix’s nearly 120,000 veterans to visit CVS MinuteClinic locations for timely and convenient care. And today, we launched a new initiative in Phoenix that aims to end veterans suicide once and for all by expanding access to training, support and resources. We have a long way to go to improve veterans’ health care, but efforts like these are important steps in the right direction."

5807,CongressmanKevinYoder,Republican,"There is no doubt our country is split on how to reform our health care system, but Americans across party lines are depending on us to get this right. While the American Health Care Act failed to achieve majority support, I remain committed to finding a solution.  I’ve met with individuals and groups across the political spectrum. Conservatives have told me they want to get the federal government out of health care, allow states to innovate, and put patients back in control. Progressives have told me they want to retain prohibitions on insurance providers denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions or placing lifetime caps on medical care. As we’ve seen, finding a compromise will be difficult. But I believe it is possible.   The bottom line is our reform agenda must focus on lowering the cost of care, getting government out of the way, putting patients back in control, and offering more options to let you choose the plan that’s best for you and your family. It must repair the damage done by Obamacare without pulling the rug out from underneath anyone. It must put America on a better, more sustainable path for our health care."

5809,janschakowsky,Democrat,"Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump promised voters time and time again that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Just one year ago, President Trump tweeted ‘I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.’  Now, as President, his first budget will reportedly propose massive cuts to those same programs. Reports indicate that it will slash funding for Social Security Disability Insurance, cut Medicaid by at least $800 billion, and shorten the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. President Trump’s proposal tomorrow is a collection of broken promises to the American people. As a member of the House Budget Committee, I will resist his outrageous proposals every step of the way."

5820,CongressmanGarretGraves,Republican,"ICYMI: We announced on Friday that $6.7 million dollars has been approved to go toward construction of the Comite River Diversion Canal. Since first serving in the House in 2015, Congress has allocated a total of $20.7 million toward the canal. This amount is grossly insufficient to finish the project, but the $20.7 million since 2015 represents the vast majority of funding for the project in the last 10 years, when funding for the project had essentially dried up.   Seeing Comite through to completion remains a top priority of mine and is critical to a true, long-term recovery in South Louisiana. Until we address the flood protection problem, lives and property remain at risk.  We also announced funding for the following projects:  $500,000 for continued wastewater and environmental improvements in Baton Rouge $500,000 for wastewater improvements in Ascension Parish $450,000 to complete the justification analysis to deepen the Mississippi River to 50 feet, thereby allowing for larger commercial vessels $9 million for continued project construction in the Louisiana Coastal Area (restoration of Coastal Louisiana)  Read more: http://www.wafb.com/story/35529377/millions-in-funding-approved-for-comite-diversion"

5830,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"Late last night, a bipartisan spending agreement was reached that would preserve funding for transportation programs the president targeted for cuts in his proposed budget. Despite his pledges to replace our crumbling infrastructure with “new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways,” the president’s plan proposed slashing the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) budget, including a  major cut for critical investments in mass transit, the end of long-distance Amtrak trains like the Lakeshore Limited, and the elimination of TIGER grants, which made the new Rochester intermodal train station and Inner Loop redevelopment projects possible. Thankfully, the newest spending agreement disregards President Trump’s misguided proposals and will provide DOT with more than $680 million above current levels. Investing in and improving our infrastructure not only helps put millions of Americans to work, it also allows our nation to remain competitive in the global economy. This increase in funding is a positive development, and I will keep fighting to ensure that transportation remains a top priority."

5839,RepMcEachin,Democrat,"I took to the House Floor today in opposition of #HJRes38, a resolution written to overrule the Stream Protection Rule.  I oppose any measure that threatens the quality of our drinking water. Clean drinking water is a fundamental public health need. Harming that basic need is one of our most basic responsibilities as legislators. We must not put special interests ahead of our constituents’ health. We have seen, in Flint, Michigan and elsewhere, the painful consequences when people lack access to safe drinking water. We must do more to prevent that kind of suffering. Nixing this rule would instead mean that we were doing less.   The Stream Protection Rule is the product of a careful, years-long process. This rule was crafted in the sunshine, but Republicans want to overrule it in what seems like the dead of night. After all the work that went into ensuring the best for Americans, this resolution of disapproval did not even receive a committee hearing. The Stream Protection Rule is very simple. It strengthens and clarifies existing water quality protections with respect to mining. It requires that affected streams be restored when mining is finished. It gives communities accurate information about water quality, so they can best protect themselves from pollution. This protective measure should not be reversed."

Last month, I sent a letter to the Attorney General expressing my deep concern with the Trump Administration’s ties to Russia during the campaign and after the election. I called for his recusal and for the appointment of special counsel to conduct an independent investigation. This has become a bipartisan call, as both House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz have called for the Attorney General’s recusal as well.  However, these recent revelations make clear that recusal is not enough. The Attorney General is the highest law enforcement official in the country and must be truly independent.

Our state’s 157th year holds tremendous promise, and I hope we realize that promise by carrying on our founders’ values and working together for the good of the state and nation. I’m grateful to again have the opportunity to serve in the United States Senate on your behalf. I take the blessing of being a Kansan to heart – each day, I hope to bring our home state’s sense of hard work, dedication to service and innate respect for our neighbors to my work in Washington, D.C.

Those hired will join the recovery team – local, state and federal workers, voluntary agencies and community organizations – already in place. Through temporary local employees, FEMA gains valuable community insights, provides jobs and puts Texans to work helping Texans.  Jobs posted recently pay between $14 and $34 per hour. Some of the jobs include: administrative support assistant, civil engineer, communications specialist, construction cost estimator, courier, crisis counselor, customer service specialist, environmental specialist, floodplain management specialist, graphics specialist, hazard mitigation outreach specialist, historic preservation specialist, registered nurse and voluntary agency liaison, among others.  The first step is to register at WorkinTexas.com, the Texas Workforce Commission’s website, where application instructions are posted. FEMA will announce more jobs soon.  ###  FEMA’s mission is to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from and mitigate all hazards.  Disaster recovery assistance is available without regard to race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age, disability, English proficiency or economic status.

That’s why I reintroduced the Border Security and Accountability Act of 2017, a comprehensive approach to border security that places the needs of Borderlands communities at the center of all security efforts. Unlike Trump’s plan, this bill is not an enforcement-only approach and it does not waste $1.6 billion of taxpayer money on walls that do nothing to enhance security. Instead, the Act establishes a humane border security strategy, modernizes border infrastructure and increases personnel at Ports of Entry, respects tribal sovereignty, and protects the unique ecosystems of the Borderlands."

The Make America Secure Appropriations Act prioritizes national security and secures our border. This legislation provides a total of $658.1 billion for the Department of Defense, including critical resources to defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups. Additionally, this bill provides a 2.4% pay raise for our troops, which is the largest pay raise for our military in 8 years, and provides the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with an increase of 5.3% as well as greater oversight and accountability at the VA. In addition to important defense funding, this legislation will also help strengthen our waterways and infrastructure, providing important funding for the Army Corps of Engineers and for flood and storm damage reduction. The Make America Secure Appropriations Act also provides $9.6 billion for Energy Programs within the Department of Energy, which includes the National Laboratory System; including Brookhaven National Lab. With House passage, the Senate must now take up this bill without delay.

The ""Aviation Humanitarian Crisis Act of 2017"" provides stability and predictability regarding commercial flight prices in critical disaster areas, and it gives people financial peace of mind when making evacuation plans. Particularly after hurricanes, we read reports that due to reduced capacity and high demand, flights are full or tickets are prohibitively expensive. And even if airlines cap flight prices—like they did last week—federal taxes and fees can increase the price of evacuation by twenty percent.   American citizens deserve better. My bill, and the ones I will be introducing over the coming weeks, will help people evacuating disaster areas on commercial flights. It will give them financial peace of mind and allow them to better focus on staying safe.   #PuertoRico #USVI #PRstrong #PuertoRicoRelief #Congress"

During my remarks this morning, I also responded to the American Bar Association’s conclusion that Grasz is “not qualified” to serve on the Eighth Circuit.

This is a chronic illness, caused by an autoimmune response that is not yet fully understood. It is also irreversible and requires multiple doses of insulin every day to keep her alive. Thankfully, they started receiving coverage under the ACA two years ago which has given them the necessary coverage for her medical expenses. And while not inexpensive, they are very thankful to have a healthcare plan that they can manage and that keeps their child receiving what she needs. Without it, Amy’s family’s out-of-pocket costs would range from $5000-$6000 every month -- an amount that they, and many other Americans, would never be able to afford.   With the current Senate GOP healthcare proposal looming, Amy has this to say: “I beg you and your fellow Senators to oppose any proposal that would take away or minimalize our current plan,” said Amy. “I understand that in certain states the ACA needs to be revised, and it is not perfect, but it has helped millions of Americans like my family, and is worth fixing and improving for all. Particularly for my child, who has a disability and a pre-existing condition which needs 24/7 medicines and equipment, I see the removal of the ACA as a direct threat to her very life.”   Thousands of people like Amy and her daughter are counting on us so that they can continue to afford the quality healthcare they deserve.

Unequivocally, Russia interfered in our election and they will be back to interfere again.  2. Comey said he documented his conversation with Trump because he was concerned Trump would lie about their meetings. This is stunning.  3. Another key point: Comey told Rosenstein about his concerns about Trump meetings. Then, Rosenstein still wrote the memo justifying his firing. Rosenstein now oversees the special investigation run by Mueller, which is something we should be concerned about. Yesterday, I pushed Rosenstein to commit in writing that Mueller has full independence — otherwise the same thing may well happen to Mueller. I didn’t receive a sufficient yes or no answer to my question yesterday, but I will keep pushing for that answer, because — as former FBI Director Comey affirmed under oath today — Mueller should have full independence.

Today, I was proud to join President Donald J. Trump at The White House as he signed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act into law.   This bill strengthens accountability at the VA by speeding up disciplinary actions, allowing recoupment or reduction in an employee’s pension, bonus, or relocation expense for misconduct, and enhances protections for whistleblowers.  Although the mountain before us is steep, this bill gives us the necessary tools to climb it. Let’s get to climbing and be true champions for our veterans!"

I support President Trump’s efforts to temporary halt non-United States citizens from these seven countries for 120 days while the Department of Homeland Security reviews ways to better protect and strengthen a flawed vetting process. We cannot afford to get this wrong, not even once out of thousands of applications. We need to put politics aside and remember that this is an issue of national security, and will ensure we strengthen our vetting procedures so that everything that can be done is done to protect this nation from radical Islamic terrorists."

5965,RepClaudiaTenney,Republican,"As well intentioned as DACA may be, the policy has encouraged an influx of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant minors who have illegally crossed our border in hopes of benefiting from the program. Attracting children here without their parents is neither compassionate nor humane. We want to welcome people to our country but ensure that when we do, we do so safely and legally. This country remains open to those looking to build a better life in pursuit of the American dream and I am honored to have spent my life in a community that has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world. At the same time, the safety of our citizens depends on strong border control and enforcement of our immigration laws.  As the legislative body, it is important that Congress address this policy.  Executive Action is not the solution—it circumvents the separation of powers, bypasses the legislative process and undermines the rule of law. Going forward, Congress must reform immigration policy and get it right, and the best way to do that is to start at the source of the problem. We must secure the border, ensure internal enforcement works, deport dangerous criminal illegal immigrants and remove the incentives for people to come to America illegally."

Amazingly, the Honor Flight Columbus group has flown over 5,000 veterans - including some from Eastern and Southeastern Ohio.  I've traveled with Honor Flight multiple times as a guardian to help our heroes enjoy their day of honor and celebration.  And, yesterday I was honored to present the 2017 Honor Flight Honoree a proclamation to recognize his many hours of support for the program.  Then I delivered a short message of thanks and encouragement to nearly 1,000 volunteers and veterans...from WWII to Korea to Vietnam.  It was a wonderful experience.

Restoring fish passage is only the first step in restoring the Klamath Basin watershed that connects Crater Lake to the redwoods. Restoring the Klamath Basin also means rebuilding community – farmers and ranchers need water certainty, rural communities need jobs, and while returning salmon help our tribal neighbors restore their culture and feed their families, they also need economic development and land restoration."

6018,congressmanbobbyrush,Democrat,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congressman Bobby L. Rush (IL) introduced  H.R. 1272 the “Cold Case Record Collections Act of  2017” to help bring justice and closure to unsolved cases stemming from the Civil Rights era.  This act allows for citizens to request certain documents from civil rights cold cases to be declassified. Currently, the classification of these documents prevents private citizens from investigating decades old cases that are still unsolved, and are unlikely to be solved exclusively by federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ).   “There are far too many unsolved crimes from the Civil Rights Movement that remain a mystery yet there is critical information found in federal case files,” Rep. Rush said. “Families and people in general deserve to know what has happened to bring closure and justice to those involved.”  Approximately 113 civil rights cold cases remain unsolved. Up until now, almost none of the cold cases solved were done exclusively by federal agencies. Cases that were solved required the help of outside investigators. Additionally, these investigators required access to documents from agencies such as the FBI and DOJ in order to solve their cases. The Cold Case Record Collections Act of 2017 provides a more efficient method of declassifying and releasing such documents to the public. This will, in turn, enable outside investigators to be able to solve cold cases more often as they will have access to more documents.  The Cold Case Record Collections Act of 2017 establishes the following:  • The “Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection” at the National Archives. • An independent agency known as the Cold Case Records Review Board. • Guidelines for the Cold Case Records Review Board to follow. • Rules and requirements for appointments to the Cold Case Records Review Board. • Procedures for the approval of declassification and release of documents reviewed by the • Cold Case Records Review Board  Currently, the Emmett Till Act encourages the DOJ to investigate these civil rights cold cases. “Though this is a good step towards finding justice, it is not enough,” Rush said. “Outside investigators are needed to help solve these cases. Many cases exist where the perpetrators are dead and thus are no longer open to prosecution. The Cold Case Record Collections Act of 2017 allows for documents concerning such cases to be released as well. This can provide the much needed closure for families of the victims.”"

6061,SteveDainesMT,Republican,"Located on the road to Glacier National Park, Phygg's Deli on The Heights in Columbia Falls has been a favorite local lunch spot for more than 30 years. It was founded in 1984 by Greg and Lorrie Trenerry, along with Greg's brother Craig (nicknamed Phygg), who first fell in love with the Flathead Valley on a Flathead River rafting trip. Greg and Lorrie still own and manage the deli. The deli is known for its excellent turkey sandwiches (most notably the Phygg's Special), turkey noodle soup, and delicious chocolate peanut butter bars. Whether you want to sit and eat lunch by the fire or grab something on your way into Glacier Park, Phygg's is a great place to get a good meal.

She threw away protections put in place by President Obama to help prevent student loan borrowers from defaulting on their loans - protections that simply ask that student loan companies treat borrowers fairly. She claims this was to limit “the cost to taxpayers,” but experts agree that taxpayers aren’t affected by these protections. There’s no good reason for this. In my mind, there’s no choice to be made.

On April 12, 1945, only hours after the death of FDR, Harry S. Truman was inaugurated President of the United States in the Cabinet Room of the White House.   With World War II still raging across Europe and the Pacific, Truman was abruptly called to lead the country through one of the most pivotal moments of its history. And the Missouri native was sworn in with none of the pageantry or fanfare we see today - there was simply no time for that.  With the weight of the world on his shoulders, Truman asked the recently-widowed Mrs. Roosevelt, ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" Famously, she replied, ""Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now."""

We need to be making strategic investments in education, infrastructure, and our national defense–something these continuing resolutions do not allow. I cannot in good conscience vote for more temporary fixes that damage our ability to invest in our own future, especially without assurances that Congress will take up a permanent solution for the DACA program.   The same goes with the inadequate disaster relief supplemental aid legislation, which was woefully insufficient. The Governor of Puerto Rico previously requested $94 billion just for its recovery efforts, but this measure only provided $81 billion to be split between Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It also included an unacceptably low amount of funding to combat the ever-growing opioid epidemic. There were 63,600 overdose deaths in 2016, far more than the 58,000 deaths in the entire Vietnam War. Congress must get serious about the funding needed to turn the tide of this crisis."

6108,jiminhofe,Republican,"On April 4, Bashar al-Assad launched a chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in northwest Syria that killed over 70 people, including dozens of children, and left hundreds wounded. Last night President Trump responded with a U.S. tomahawk strike against a Syrian airfield. The immediate and proportional airstrike against the Syrian’s Shayrat Airfield was a justified and appropriate response to the Assad regime’s indiscriminate and heinous chemical attack on Syrian civilians Through this strike, President Trump signaled to Assad, Russia and the rest of the world that egregious violations of international law and norms of behavior will not go unanswered by the new administration. The United States, under the Trump administration, will play an emboldened leadership role worldwide; the days where our enemies don’t fear us and our allies don’t trust us are over.  The world is as dangerous now as at any time in my lifetime and the complex situation in Syria highlights that danger. These strikes underscore the requirement to immediately begin to repair the damage the Obama administration did by slashing military budgets and gutting military readiness, weakening the position of the U.S. globally. We must rebuild our military and national security so that we may achieve peace through strength. I applaud the president for his action."
6109,RepBrianBabin,Republican,"This is long overdue.

6112,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"In an executive order earlier this year, President Trump dramatically cut the number of refugees allowed onto our shores. In fact, he set the lowest cap ever by the executive branch and less than half of that set by the previous administration.  As of this afternoon, that cap has been reached. This is devastating news for people across the globe seeking asylum from their home countries. In 2016, 65 million people were displaced from their homes. Nearly half of them were children. Without asylum, these individuals will be forced to undergo continued persecution. Today especially, the president’s decision to slam the door in the face of refugees sends a dangerous signal to the rest of the world that protecting the most vulnerable among us is no longer a top concern. We are a nation of immigrants and we must honor that history by continuing to responsibly welcome vulnerable people from all over the world."

6118,marshablackburn,Republican,"President Trump's decision to nominate Judge Neil Gorsuch for the vacancy on the Supreme Court should be applauded.

President Reagan taught us about leadership, and lessons about faith, freedom, liberty, and a strong, prosperous America. My favorite Reagan quote is: ""It Can Be Done!"", which is proudly displayed on my desk. President Reagan believed the best about the American people, and inspired us to listen to our best among us.  Like many Americans, I look back on his years in office fondly...he was uniquely and unfailingly optimistic -- whether staring down the Soviet Union during the Cold War, or dealing with former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill and the Democratic party to adopt his economic agenda.  President Reagan was a giant among world leaders, and was one of our greatest presidents.  He reminded us often that America's greatest days are yet to come...I still believe that."

I've been proud to be part of the effort to make this center a reality, and am pleased that we were able to pass bipartisan legislation in the House, the SELF DRIVE Act, to support the development of automated vehicle technologies. This is about improving safety, supporting the auto industry’s comeback, and helping to create more cutting-edge jobs in our state. The American Center for Mobility will help keep Michigan in the driver's seat for decades to come as we transform the Arsenal of Democracy into the Arsenal of Innovation."

Ignoring this reality, Trump’s executive order will irresponsibly roll back the progress we made under President Obama to protect our environment for generations to come. And Trump's order does nothing to create 21st century jobs or make us competitive in the global economy.  Environmental protection and economic growth go hand in hand with smart, effective policies.

In Congress, I am proud to work with Rep.

6184,johnmccain,Republican,"In recent months, United States and coalition forces have achieved major gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Building upon the retaking of Mosul in July, U.S. coalition partners have liberated ISIS’s former capital of Raqqa in Syria, the pocket of Hawija in northern Iraq, and, just days ago, the border town of Al-Qaim in western Iraq. The so-called caliphate that terrorists claimed would overrun the Middle East is now a shadow of its former self—a shrinking swathe on a map once defined by an open reign of terror.     Unfortunately, however, our challenges in the region remain daunting despite these hard-fought tactical victories. Our relentless focus on destroying ISIS has obscured a troubling reality: the United States lacks a clear, comprehensive strategy that addresses the Middle East in all of its complexity.            This is part of the unfortunate legacy that the Obama Administration left for its successor. But nearly one year into the Trump Administration, we lack clarity on essential questions about our nation’s role. Our elected leaders must articulate a comprehensive strategy that reflects these judgments with specificity and detail rather than piecemeal offerings and tactical victories. Congress, with our constitutional role as a co-equal branch of government, and more importantly, the American people deserve no less."

6214,betoorourketx16,Democrat,"Usually, we like to share a key moment from a hearing with you – an exchange or two that captures the theme of the hearing, and how Beto is representing you here in Congress. Today, that felt insufficient and the topic of discussion – helping veterans overcome PTSD – too valuable not to share in its entirety.   This morning’s discussion could be the first of many that will meaningfully reframe the way we talk about and address PTSD – not simply as a clinical diagnosis, but as a far more complex adjustment issue that deserves both rehabilitation and empowerment. Importantly, this hearing made plain that as a community, we have a responsibility to help support and reintegrate the less than 1-percent of our fellow Americans that have assumed the burden of war on our behalf.   Of course, not all invisible wounds can be addressed holistically. We know that access to timely and effective mental healthcare is a key component of reducing veteran suicide. This begins with ensuring our VA facilities have the resources to hire and retain the necessary mental healthcare providers. However, we also know that of the 20 veterans a day that are committing suicide, 14 of those are not receiving healthcare from the VA. This figure betrays an unacceptable gap in healthcare coverage for our nation’s most vulnerable veterans.    A meaningful step toward closing this gap would be to extend mental healthcare benefits to those former service members with “other-than-honorable” (or, “bad paper”) discharges, as most veterans with this discharge status are unable to access healthcare services from the VA.   This is especially troubling given that according to data from the Department of Defense, 62-percent, or 57,141 of the service members separated for misconduct from 2011 through 2015 had been diagnosed within the 2 years prior to their separation with PTSD, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or other mental health conditions that could be associated with misconduct.  These figures, especially in the context of the accounts we heard this morning, emphasize why it is more important now than ever to enact the Honor our Commitment Act (H.R. 1685), legislation authored by Congressman O’Rourke and Senator Chris Murphy that would extend VA mental health coverage for these former service members, and provide access to care for those veterans who need it the most.   We hope you’ll find the remarks from this morning’s hearing as meaningful as we did, and that we can work together to ensure returning service members receive the support and dignity they deserve. I am grateful for Brendan O’Byrne, a United States Army Veteran; Sebastian Junger, an American journalist and the author of Tribe; Zach Iscol, a United States Marine Corps Veteran and Executive Director of the Headstrong Project; and Paul Downs, a United States Marine Corps Veteran and staff member of the Boulder Crest Retreat Team for their testimony and tireless dedication to helping our nation’s veterans overcome PTSD.

6232,senatormenendez,Democrat,"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has once again confirmed that Republicans’ so-called American Health Care Act does not actually improve health care for Americans. Under the GOP’s cruel plan, 14 million Americans will lose their health coverage in the next year, and 23 million people will be uninsured by 2027.   The GOP legislation may save health insurance executives and hedge fund managers a whole lot of money – but it won’t save lives.  This awful bill still ends federal protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. It still slashes Medicaid by over $800 billion, threatening expansion coverage for 552,000 New Jerseyans and jeopardizing care for millions of nursing home patients, disabled Americans, and low-income kids nationwide. And it still ends federally-guaranteed coverage for essential health benefits that all families depend on, from hospital stays and prescription drug coverage to maternity care and mental health and substance abuse treatment.   Every American deserves the right to see a doctor without the fear of going bankrupt. But if House Republicans and the President have their way, 23 million more Americans will live with that fear once again."

This was just weeks after a groundbreaking story surfaced showing the VA failed to disclose bad medical practitioners to the public, including one notorious offender at Togus, Thomas Franchini, a surgeon who committed malpractice in 88 separate cases at Togus.  Today I directly questioned VA officials to help get to the bottom of these horrible findings. There is absolutely no excuse for our Veterans to have any doubt about the quality of care they receive and the personnel who administer it. The VA should be held to the highest standard and direct accountability for all those who fail to do their jobs and who could put our Veterans at risk. We must see some changes made."

6246,mcmorrisrodgers,Republican,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the farewell address President Obama gave last night. His speech reminds me of the stories I hear from people across Eastern Washington who are being crushed by all of the rules and regulations that came out of his presidency. You may be asking yourself, what does all of this talk about “rules and regulations” actually mean?  Well, for the local business owner or family, it means unnecessary, expensive, jobs-crushing mandates, and it’s a big reason why our economy isn’t doing as well as it could be.   This is why I’m so pleased to see House Republicans kicking off the year by undoing and reining in the most harmful aspects of President Obama’s legacy: burdensome rules and regulations. It’s an important step we’re taking to set the table for our unified Republican government to make real progress for people."

6251,RepStephMurphy,Democrat,"President Trump’s budget is both morally and fiscally irresponsible, using smoke and mirrors to make false claims about its real fiscal impact.

6260,CongressmanJodyHice,Republican,"With all the noise coming out of Washington lately, big-ticket items, like health care and tax reform, have been on the forefront of most of our minds.  While these are important issues we’re tackling, they’ve also drowned out some of the other valuable things Congress is doing. With that in mind, I want to take the time to outline a few of my own legislative proposals I’m very proud to be introducing in the coming months.  Just a few short weeks ago, the House passed Kate’s Law to crack down on sanctuary cities after witnessing the devastation that can arise from policies that effectively roll out the welcome mat for illegal immigrants. Perhaps even more shocking, however, are the loopholes in our legal system that allow these criminal aliens who are sex offenders to wander freely around our communities without being registered on sex offender rolls and without the knowledge of our law enforcement officials. My bill, the Sex Offender Registration & Tracking Improvement Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to collect extensive information about these offenders and share it with the Department of Justice, as well as local law enforcement, to ensure that these criminals are placed on sex offender registries.  All sex offenders — regardless of immigration status — should be identified and registered.  Public safety must not be a partisan issue, and I am proud to be introducing this bill soon.  Another measure I’m working on is the Strengthening Aviation Security Act. Since 2001, the Transportation Security Administration has aimed to increase the number of federal air marshals they place on flights. However, in deciding which flights they are placed on, the Government Accountability Office found the TSA fails to use a quantitative risk assessment to clearly demonstrate which flights are higher risk and therefore deserving of extra attention.  When it comes to protecting our skies, we need to use every method at our disposal. This includes both the qualitative professional judgment of experts and quantitative evidence-based strategies. The Strengthening Aviation Security Act would require the Federal Air Marshal Service incorporate risk-based strategies in deciding domestic and international air marshal allocation.  Please know, although I’ll be heading down to Georgia for the August “recess,” my legislative and constituent work will continue. I’ll be taking meetings and visiting with folks across the district to hear what’s most important to you and discuss how we can move forward together.  You may rest assured my team and I are working day in and day out to enact meaningful legislation that will benefit the citizens of the 10th District, our state and our great nation."

6324,lloyddoggett,Democrat,"Each year I join the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) to identify hazardous toys to avoid. The federal agency with consumer protection responsibilities on this and other product dangers is now under attack by Trump. His nominee to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission “has opposed limiting dangerous carbon monoxide emissions in portable generators; resisted requiring safety technology on table saws....[and] rejected fines against companies that delayed reporting hazards to the agency, as required by law."" Trump's pick is so cozy to industry that she has voted against 16 of 21 proposed settlements. In many cases, she argued they should be lower than the amount businesses originally agreed to. What happened to #DraintheSwamp?"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Purdue and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have reaffirmed their commitment to improving our forestry management practices, and I believe Congress should treat wildfires the same as hurricanes and other disasters.

Just last week, we witnessed the kind of violence that can result from the increasing vitriol in our public discourse. We have to return to the ideals that made our country great and to the idea that every person is worthy of dignity and respect.  This week I joined my colleagues in both parties in recommitting to #civility and in establishing a National Day of Civility to serve as a reminder that before we are Republicans and Democrats, we are first and foremost Americans."

Lawmakers in both parties and both chambers are finalizing legislative text that incorporates a deal hammered out between the FDA and industry over the last several years and are preparing to push the changes through next year. The House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee could mark up legislation as soon as this month, several aides tell STAT. Key senators are also hoping to introduce their own bill within the next several weeks, aides in that chamber said.  “Nothing in [the current system] makes perfect sense,” Dr. Theresa Michele, a director at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told STAT. “We strongly believe that these changes will better serve and protect the public health, so we’re pretty excited about them.""  In the House, key Energy and Commerce Committee leaders and Reps. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) have led the push for the overhaul. In the Senate, it’s the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions panel and Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.)."""
6370,RepMarkDeSaulnier,Democrat,"Last night, after seven years, Republicans revealed their long-awaited health care plan, which would cause millions of Californians to lose their coverage, increase premiums and deductibles for working families, force seniors to pay five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, and cause 11 million Americans to lose coverage through the termination of Medicaid expansion. The plan provides massive tax incentives to insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, and the wealthy, but has yet to be reviewed by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office to determine how it will impact taxpayers and the federal deficit. Rushing legislation through committees without a thorough vetting is reckless and rolls back years of progress made under the Affordable Care Act. #NotAPlan #TrumpCare"

I’m glad Regional Administrator Patton accepted my invitation to spend a day on Staten Island. Her commitment to personally visiting projects critical to Staten Island’s future emphasizes her focus and determination at the helm of HUD’s regional office. It’s no secret that New York City’s recovery from Superstorm Sandy was too slow, too bureaucratic, and too expensive. There’s plenty of blame to go around, including how Congress wrote the Sandy aid bill and how the City implemented it, and I hope we can learn from our mistakes.

WOTUS also takes away property rights and leads to litigation and lost jobs for farmers in my district. It’s time to completely erase #WOTUS, and this executive order is a step in that direction."

6399,SenatorPatrickLeahy,Democrat,"Senate Trumpcare 2.0 is just as bad as earlier versions and in some ways is worse.  This remains a stumbling, shameful and craven exercise to pass a tax bill in the guise of a health care bill.  The ‘mean’ House bill the President described keeps getting meaner.  Lost to many in the White House and on Capitol Hill is the fact that these are decisions that literally mean health or illness and life or death to countless people.  Not much is new in the latest Trumpcare bill.  It will still drop millions of Americans from Medicaid support – working families who are struggling, parents and grandparents in nursing homes, and families coping to care for members with disabilities.  It will make it harder for Americans with pre-existing conditions to find and buy insurance, and it will decimate Vermont’s ability to combat opioid and drug addiction.  It will inflate premiums and deductibles, particularly on older Americans, and will price millions of families and individuals out of being able to afford coverage.  It is way past time for Senate Republicans and this White House to stop this reckless exercise and work with us to find ways to bring lifesaving health care to more Americans, not to fewer families, as the Republican plan would do.    I will continue to strongly oppose this shameful proposal.  I hope those members on both sides of the political aisle who have previously spoken out in opposition to these proposals will stand firm.  Instead going behind closed doors to make health care harder to have, let’s work together to build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and make it better.  Don’t undermine families’ access to insurance and the health care they need."

6403,RepBarbaraComstock,Republican,Enjoyed a tour and a roundtable with leadership and staff at Gainesville Health & Rehab Center where we discussed longterm care and the continued need to work with our healthcare professionals on regulatory issues. It is critical that we streamline the regulations that impact them so they can work more efficiently and spend more time with their patients.

6411,repcurbelo,Republican,"After months of spirited debate and thoughtful conversations about what American families and businesses need to make sure the economic recovery reaches every household, we’re entering the final phase of a pro-growth, pro-family, simplified tax code. I look forward to keeping a close eye on the conference deliberations and debating the final bill on the House Floor.

6414,Rep.BluntRochester,Democrat,It was great touring Bethany Beach yesterday to discuss beach preservation issues. Maintaining Delaware's pristine beaches will be vitally important to ensure that Delaware's tourism industry continues to have a positive effect on our economy.
6415,CongressmanKevinYoder,Republican,"The men and women of law enforcement across the Third District put their lives on the line every day to keep our community safe. Making sure they have the resources they need to meet their mission, and making sure they are given the respect and gratitude they deserve is something I take very seriously in my role as a community leader and Member of Congress. That’s why I’ve supported measures like the Rapid DNA Act, a bill that’s headed to the President’s desk for signature that would give police the tools to do virtually immediate DNA testing to help solve crimes and exonerate those who are innocent. I’ve also joined my colleagues in passing the Thin Blue Line Act, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act to help encourage the hiring of veterans as police officers, Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to end the practice of sanctuary cities, and supported the use of body cameras throughout our communities. I enjoyed speaking with members of the Olathe Police Department last night about these issues and more at the Olathe Citizens Police Advisory Council, and want to thank Keith Brown for inviting me."

6419,113303673339.0,Democrat,"As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, we remember those who have made opportunities possible for so many, like George Washington Carver (1864-1943). In 1890, Carver enrolled in Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, where he studied Art. He later transferred to Iowa State to study agriculture, where he earned his Master’s degree by 1896. After accepting an offer from Booker T. Washington, Carver then moved to Alabama where he served as the head of the Agricultural Department at Tuskegee Institute (a historically black college, HBCU). Carver’s research at Tuskegee was innovative in improving efficiency for farmers. Carver became a figure head in agriculture and an icon for the black community.  Carver’s contributions to society can still be felt in places like our home state of Georgia. Even with Carver’s success in agriculture and at an HBCU, there is still more to be done. I am proud to be working to address these issues by introducing legislation in Congress, H.R. 51, the Funding for Student Scholarships for the 1890s Land-Grant African-American Colleges and Universities Act. This bill would establish and provide funding for a grant program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture for scholarships for students who attend historically black colleges and universities established under the Second Morrill Act of 1890. It would allow the USDA to award scholarships to students who want to attend these colleges and intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.   Our commitment to the success of our young people is always a priority in hopes for American’s bright future. I will continue to do the work necessary to ensure these possibilities."

6424,RepStevePearce,Republican,"Today, the House voted on a package that irresponsibly included an extension of the debt limit and a Continuing Resolution to disaster relief funds for Harvey and Irma.

6425,RepJeffDuncan,Republican,"We're voting on hundreds of amendments this week to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). One of those amendments offered by Vicki Hartzler of Missouri would prohibit taxpayer dollars from being used for gender reassignment surgery for military personnel and their family members, which has an estimated to cost $1.35 billion over 10 years. Passing this amendment and banning the government from picking up the tab on this should be common sense, right? Wrong! The amendment was defeated 214-209. Every Democrat voted against the amendment along with 23 Republicans. We're $20 trillion dollars in debt, the VA is in shambles, our soldiers aren't paid enough, and we're at war with Islamic State, but sure, let's spend a billion dollars on this. The military restricts people with asthma from serving in the military, but we're going to pay out billions for people who want to change their sex?

6431,repdavereichert,Republican,"Today at noon, Deputy Wesley F. Cherry was honored 163 years after his death with the State of Washington’s highest honor, the Law Enforcement Medal of Honor. This award is reserved for members of law enforcement who were killed in the line of duty or distinguished themselves by exceptional conduct.   Before Washington became a state in 1889, Deputy Cherry sacrificed to keep his community safe. On March 5th 1854, Deputy Cherry joined his colleagues to search for the suspects who killed William Young. They traveled by canoe to Holmes Beach on Whidbey Island where they were able to catch one of the suspects.  As they were preparing to leave the island, they were attacked by a group of men and Deputy Cherry was shot and fatally wounded. He passed away in Seattle the next day, making him the first law enforcement officer to die in the line of duty in what is now Washington State.   Thank you to Deputy Cherry and all those who came after him for the incredible sacrifice made on behalf of our safety."

6456,repstephenlynch,Democrat,"I joined Congressman Peter Welch and 30 other House Democrats in introducing a resolution urging President-elect Donald Trump to comply with the United States Constitution and sever ties with private business in order to avoid dangerous financial conflicts of interest. By allowing foreign governments to grant personal financial benefits directly to the President and to companies that his family owns, President-elect Trump is putting our democracy at risk. This is in blatant disregard for the Constitution and his ambivalence towards promptly addressing these troubling conflict of interest issues is a distraction from the important work that lies before us. Alexander Hamilton made it clear in the Federalist papers that a ""weak side in republics, among their numerous advantages, is that, they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption."" Thankfully, Hamilton and our other Founding Fathers had the sense more than two centuries ago to safeguard our democracy from corruption with the emoluments clause which prohibits the President from accepting personal financial gain from foreign governments.

6466,repfrankpallone,Democrat,"I released the following statement on my vote against H.Con.Res. 71 – the Fiscal Year 2018 Republican Budget Resolution.   “The Republican budget is a sham, pure and simple.  It is a cover for Republicans to give huge tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, and multinational corporations at the expense of the rest of us.  The GOP tax plan would also make it harder for working people across New Jersey – many of my constituents would see their average tax burden increase by more than $16,000.  This is primarily because their plan eliminates the tax deduction for state and local income and property taxes.   “To achieve this backwards-thinking tax philosophy, the Republican budget would gut investments in education, infrastructure, innovation, clean energy, job training, medical research, and health care – including cutting Medicaid by $1.1 trillion and Medicare by $487 billion.  It is irresponsible and shameful, which is why I voted against its passage.   “There is a better way forward.  One that invests in the American people and commits to their future.  One that prioritizes good jobs, great education, world-leading research, affordable and accessible healthcare, and our climate.  I was proud to vote for budget alternatives that prioritize those efforts, and I will continue to work every day to advance them, even as many of my Republican colleagues remain dead-set on rolling back progress and padding the pockets of their rich friends.”"

6474,RepKennyMarchant,Republican,"Following the vote in the House of Representatives to advance HR 1628 The American Health Care Act to the Senate, U.S. Congressman Kenny Marchant (TX-24) released the following statement:  ""In November, the American people voted for relief from the skyrocketing costs of health insurance. The legacy of Obamacare is out-of-control premiums, fewer choices for patients, and unaffordable deductibles. Today, I voted again to repeal and dismantle Obamacare. After listening to the concerns of my constituents regarding pre-existing conditions, after significant patient protections were added, and after ensuring Congress was not exempted from this legislation, I support advancing this bill to the Senate. American health insurance is in crisis, reform is not a choice, it’s a necessity.  Right now one-third of all counties in the United States have only one insurance option and that number is climbing. Just yesterday it was reported that the entire state of Iowa could be left with no individual options to purchase health insurance in 2018. This crisis won’t fix itself. Millions of Americans have opted to pay a fine to the government and remain uninsured because it’s actually cheaper than Obamacare premiums.  Continued improvements will be made to stabilize the industry that’s crumbling around us. This is about dismantling the Obamacare regulations that have hurt so many families and businesses in Texas. Right now, an elderly couple in Texas making $80,000 a year is mandated by Washington to buy one-size-fits-all insurance they don’t want or need. Under the AHCA, this couple would now receive an $8,000 tax credit to buy insurance that actually fits their lifestyle. Conservative principles like this have been part health insurance discussions for decades.  We’ve seen what happens when Washington bureaucrats take charge of health insurance – health care plans you’re forced to buy but can’t afford to use. Choosing between Obamacare and the American Health Care Act is a false choice, because Obamacare is collapsing. Saying no is easy, saving insurance for American families before it’s gone is worth a yes.”"

6483,RepLouiseSlaughter,Democrat,"Like Congressman Conyers before him, Senator Franken made the right decision in resigning. Republicans should now take a hard look at members of their own caucus. They have a president who admitted to sexual assault, which should have been disqualifying, a House member who has used taxpayer funds to settle harassment allegations, and a candidate running for Senate who has been accused of child molestation and harassment. If the national reckoning on sexual harassment is going to truly change Washington, we must adhere to the highest standards for all public officials. Women are tired of being treated as pawns subjected to such awful conduct."

6487,SenatorSasse,Republican,"NPR asked me in an interview: why support Judge Gorsuch's nomination? My answer: I think he's the kind of judge the founders envisioned.   When you look at his opinions, as I've started doing over the last few weeks when he was one of the finalists, it's really hard to figure out his policy and political preferences on any issue. He's a judge's judge who believes in three separate branches of government: Congress writes laws, the president administers them, and a judge's job is to protect our rights.  In the Constitution, the Supreme Court does not have any place for purple or for blue or for red jerseys for justices. Every American should be able to celebrate the fact that we aspire to nine justices who are looking to defend our rights and to defend the Constitution, not to advance policy preferences.

6488,RepPerlmutter,Democrat,"In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson established National Small Business Week to recognize the contributions of small, independently owned businesses.   According to the Small Business Administration, in Colorado, there are more than 596,000 small businesses which employ about 1.1 million people. The three industries in Colorado with the most small business employment include accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance and construction. Across the country, more than half of Americans own or work for a small business, creating around two out of every three net new jobs in the United States.  Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth in our communities and small businesses are vital for American innovation and prosperity. #COSBW"

6494,repdonbeyer,Democrat,"Some good news this month: solar energy has grown so fast it now employs twice as many Americans as coal. Some of that change is due to a decline in coal, but much is due to the sharp rise of solar, which one survey said accounted for 1 in 50 new US jobs in 2016.   Clean energy is on the rise, thanks in large part to the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program, which I defended along with other Committee on Science, Space, & Technology - Democrats in a hearing today. This is better for the US economy, for our health, and for the planet Earth."
6495,reptomgraves,Republican,Check out the Calhoun Times to see my update on what Congress has accomplished during President Donald J. Trump's first eight months in office:
6496,RepRatcliffe,Republican,"Today President Donald J. Trump took action to help support the hiring of American labor to make and sell more products in the U.S. I look forward to working with the administration to ensure our country's immigration policies are bolstering job growth rather than undermining it, while also ensuring our businesses have access to the workforce they need continue growing."
6497,CongressmanWarrenDavidson,Republican,"I think the goal of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is to protect consumers. The reality is that when our Democrat friends initially structured the CFPB they did it with zero support from Republicans. They did it not to protect consumers and instead did it in a way that has a nice sounding name but is in fact very pernicious in its effect on the economy. I think Director Mick Mulvaney is a great choice for consumers in Ohio and across the country. I believe he will work to restore constitutional governance to the CFPB, which has been fraught with politicized conduct under its former Director Richard Cordray."
6498,JackieSpeier,Democrat,"How did the Republican Tax Scam pay for its trillions in corporate giveaways? By drilling the Arctic Refuge. This is another corporate giveaway to Big Oil and it’s morally repugnant. Like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, the Arctic Refuge is an iconic American landmark. Are we truly abandoning future generations for oily greed today? We must preserve our public lands and protect the communities and wildlife that depend on them."

6501,repjimjordan,Republican,"Deadlines influence behavior. We have a six-month time frame to force a debate in Congress about how to deal with DACA, immigration, visa overstays, and the border security wall. That is how it’s supposed to work. President Trump recognized that a federal judge would rule the DACA program unconstitutional. He wanted a responsible timeline for winding things down, and he put the issue rightly back in the hands of Congress. Now we have time to have this debate, and I’m hoping the end result will be something consistent with what we told you all when you sent us here."
6502,ChelliePingree,Democrat,"A little snow didn't keep us from christening the USS Hudner at Bath Iron Works today, named for Korean War hero Thomas Hudner who was in attendance. Hudner crash landed his plane during a battle in the Chosin Reservoir to try to save the life of a fellow aviator who had crashed. His selflessness and courage earned him the Medal of Honor--may his spirit help strengthen this fine ship and the men and women who will serve aboard her."

6504,LamarSmithTX21,Republican,"This morning I met with Brigadier General Heather Pringle,  Commander of Joint Base San Antonio, for an update on their operations.  We discussed the challenges the base addresses as the San Antonio metropolitan area continues to grow and how JBSA works with city leaders, non-profits and other government agencies to find efficiencies and cost-savings through partnerships."
6505,betoorourketx16,Democrat,"As we continue to debate our nation's immigration policy, we need to be honest about the facts – the border between the United States and Mexico has never been safer."
6506,chrisvanhollen,Democrat,"The Attorney General holds a very special position in our democracy, serving as a champion for the people and a defender of those whose only power lies in their rights under the law and in our Constitution. Nominees must be judged based on whether their life's work demonstrates a commitment to meeting the mission of the office they are asked to lead. The Latin motto on the Department of Justice's seal refers to the Attorney General as the one ‘who prosecutes on behalf of justice.’ The Attorney General must be the people’s lawyer and be zealous in the pursuit of justice for all Americans. After reviewing the record of Senator Sessions, I am not convinced that he will be a vigorous defender of the rights of all Americans, especially those who have fallen victim to the powerful or the status quo.   Long before I considered running for elected office myself, I had the honor of working for Senator Mac Mathias of Maryland. In 1986, despite being a member of the Republican Party, Senator Mathias was one of the deciding votes against then U.S. Attorney Sessions' nomination for a federal judgeship.   Since then, Senator Sessions’ statements and actions have done little to reassure Americans. On the contrary, his record of words and deeds—with respect to civil rights, voting rights, women's rights,  LGBT rights, and the rights of individuals with disabilities—reveal that he too often sides with the powerful and the status quo rather than standing up for justice for all. We need an Attorney General who will apply the law to make more real the promise of equal rights and equal justice in America, and the record to date indicates that Senator Sessions fails to meet that important test.   In addition, I am deeply troubled by the positions Senator Sessions has taken on issues related to immigration reform and I am not persuaded that he would be an independent check on an incoming President who has made clear that he is prepared to trample the rights of immigrants and religious minorities.   For all these reasons, while I respect Senator Sessions' record of service to his state in the Senate for 20 years, I do not believe he should serve as our next Attorney General."
6507,RepDebbieDingell,Democrat,"This executive order is the most extreme and blatant attempt yet to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care Act and cause instability in the marketplace. Under the President’s plan, insurers will once again be allowed to offer junk policies that provide no coverage at all, taking us back to a time when Americans were one serious illness or injury away from bankruptcy.   The American people are demanding real solutions to the challenges facing our health care system. Rather than increasing costs and gutting protections for those with pre-existing conditions, President Trump and Congressional Republicans should come together with Democrats to stabilize the marketplace, bring down costs and extend quality, affordable coverage to more families. This is what the American people demand and it is what they deserve."
6508,repscottperry,Republican,"During National Police Week, we learned more about the efforts and added value of our canine law enforcement officers during our Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency hearing.

6536,SenLisaMurkowski,Republican,"I am pleased with President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and I look forward to meeting with him and discussing issues of importance to Alaskans. With Judge Gorsuch, western states like Alaska get an individual who understands our lives and lifestyles. He is respected by legal scholars across ideological boundaries and is an originalist and textualist in the model of Justice Scalia. There is no quarrel about his extraordinary intellect, his compelling style of writing, and his commitment to justice. I particularly support Gorsuch in his belief that we must reconsider the Chevron doctrine, which provides that when a regulation is challenged in court, the court must defer to the agency’s interpretation of its own regulation. We share the same belief that the scales should not be tilted in favor of federal agencies when citizens challenge regulations. Those challenging federal actions deserve a level playing field, and I believe they will get that with Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. I give credit to President Trump on this strong nominee."

The result is unacceptable uncertainty – for businesses that create jobs, military men and women who safeguard national security, and all Americans demanding confidence in their government.   A bipartisan compromise is necessary, which means far-right Republicans abandoning their ideological blinders and negotiating in good faith.

But violence is never the solution. We need to debate and discuss our differences rationally. No matter how divided we might be in our opinions, we absolutely cannot accept this violence as the new norm for settling our differences.

I heard outrage at the notion of gutting public education and replacing it with a voucher system. I listened to Southern Arizonans call for real immigration reform that treats immigrants with the dignity they deserve, and respects the profound impact that our policies have on local border economies. And I heard a clear and consistent call to end the corporate influence over our energy policy – Arizonans know it’s time to accept science as fact and develop the sustainable, 21st century economy we so desperately need.   I invite Mr. Trump and Congressional Republicans to do one simple thing if they want to fix our problems instead of creating new ones: Listen to the American people."

This year, about seven of every 10 LGBTQ students will be verbally harassed, about one in five will be physically harassed, and more than one in eight will be physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation, gender expression, or gender. More than half of LGBTQ students feel unsafe in their own classrooms, and nearly one third will miss a day of school this month because of threats, harassment, or violence.  That’s unacceptable. Today is the #DayOfSilence; tomorrow, Americans must speak out louder than ever."

6615,SenatorSasse,Republican,"Only one American sport has a known founding — a clear creator and beginning—basketball.  It all started in December 1891, when the cold Massachusetts temperature drove guys inside. James Naismith saw how restless they were.  They missed their usual outdoor sports. And indoor-baseball was never going to take off.   The director of the Springfield Young Men’s Christian Association tapped Naismith to create a new indoor sport, an “athletic distraction” to help the guys make it through winter. It had to “be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play in the winter and by artificial light.” And it needed to be more strategic than forceful - no broken bones.  Naismith studied rugby, baseball, lacrosse, and soccer, thinking about ways to adapt the best parts of each sport to a small gym. He ended up with two peach baskets and a soccer ball. He nailed the baskets 10 feet up, wrote 13 rules, and launched a basketball league.    The first game, nine-on-nine, launched on this day, December 21, in 1891. It had two 15-minute halves and ended with a score of 9-3.   The game spread quickly. Dribbling was added. YMCA leagues formed around the country. In 1901, colleges added basketball to their sponsored sports. Eventually, holes got cut in the bottom of baskets so the ball would drop through automatically. And the number of players on the court dropped to 5.  Less than 40 years after its invention, the sport they called “basketball” became an Olympic sport.   A few thoughts:   First — Naismith’s attempt was the third in the history of the YMCA challenge to create a winter sport. Unlike the guys who came before him, Naismith wanted to create a sport that felt like play, that was strategic and fun. I love that joy and curiosity.  Second — Naismith wasn’t an athlete first and foremost. He had deep pastoral roots and a degree in theology. This guy created a sport out of a desire to serve students, not to make millions.   So the next time you catch a basketball game, think about James Naismith and his heart for service. What would it look like for us to see the challenges in our community as an opportunity for innovation and creativity as well?"

6620,repgregwalden,Republican,"Enough smoke. Enough fires.  Enough is enough. When Cycle Oregon and performances at the Shakespeare Festival in Ashland get canceled because of fires and the toxic smoke, it’s long past time for Congress to address how federal forests are managed and how fires are fought (or not), including policies that affect firefighting in wilderness areas.   When people in Central Oregon, the Gorge (or just about anywhere on the east side this summer) are told to stay inside, it’s time for a change in federal policy so that decisions to let fires burn include a review of how doing so will add carbon and toxic pollutants into the atmosphere, threaten habitat and water quality and destroy private timberlands and property.  It’s also time for the U.S. Senate to stop blocking our bipartisan legislation that has passed overwhelmingly in the House year-after-year which would help prevent catastrophic forest fires by allowing proper management. Further, the bill would provide resources to clean up after forest fires and restore the forests with new trees for another generation.   The House Resources Committee has once again approved legislation-- the Resilient Federal Forests Act--that solves the fire borrowing problem, but more importantly, gives foresters and firefighters new tools to help protect our forests, watersheds and airsheds from the kinds of disasters we endured this summer. I know we’re always going to have fires, but we must find better ways to control and extinguish them.   Soon the House will take up this measure and send it to the Senate. I’m convinced President Trump will sign it into law if only we can get it to his desk."

6622,CongressmanSethMoulton,Democrat,"""While I firmly believe that it is essential for Congress to renew the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and funding for Community Health Centers (CHC), this partisan legislation would pay for these programs by cutting billions from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) which was created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to make national investments in prevention and public health. If this bill becomes law, $129 million will be cut from the Massachusetts Public Health Fund alone... I reject the notion that we cannot reauthorize these programs without plundering other equally vital programs."""

I will continue to protect the constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners."
6636,RepPoliquin,Republican,"Mainers deserve a tax break. We’re going to deliver it to them.  Earlier this month, I voted to move the tax proposal forward in the House, trusting the Senate would continue to work on it and improve it. Now, they are doing their work, like we did in the House.  My colleague Senator Collins helped to make improvements to this proposal that I strongly support and that will benefit Maine families and small businesses, such as retaining the medical expense deduction and improving the provision dealing with historic tax credits. Senator Collins and I have both said there are problems with ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, that we need to fix, and I’m pleased this new law starts to fix those problems.  As the Senate works to finalize and vote on this tax reform proposal, I look forward to continuing our work, across the aisle and across the Capitol, to finish this landmark tax reform proposal to help our Maine families keep more of their hard-earned money and to giving our small businesses—the backbone of Maine’s economy—relief so they can grow and create more jobs for our fellow Mainers."

Participating in this charade by turning over any information – public or non-public – is a waste of time and money that only lends voice to a false narrative about voter fraud.   New Jersey is clearly in the right to deny non-public voter information, but our state needs to ignore this commission’s requests all together. If the commission wants information on New Jersey voters, it can track it down on its own. State resources should not be wasted doing it."

This week in the Joint Economic Committee hearing on tax reform and entrepreneurship claims kept being made that were disconnected from what I saw in business. I just had to call it out. This talking point from some on the other side of the aisle that we need their tax reform plan in order to encourage new business formation just doesn’t add up. Look at where the vast majority of venture capital investment is going right now: Northern California, New York and Massachusetts, three high-tax areas.  If we really want to encourage more entrepreneurship we need to 1) invest in research and education so that we keep encouraging innovation, 2) incentivize private sector investment in underserved regions and make sure that we expand our transportation and broadband infrastructure and 3) make sure people have access to health care so they can start a new job."

6670,RepBrianBabin,Republican,"Today, the House passed a balanced budget plan that paves the way for tax reform and relief. Just like hardworking Americans, it is time the federal government lives within its means and prioritizes government spending. Our budget cuts overgrown federal bureaucracy while laying the groundwork for passing pro-growth tax relief for American workers. For far too long, America’s middle-class families have struggled to make ends meet. It is time we have a tax code that works for all Americans and allows them to keep more of their hard-earned money."
6671,SenatorTedCruz,Republican,"Any time you have an act of domestic terrorism, I think the Department of Justice needs to engage and investigate and prosecute. The video of what appears to be a white supremacist or a Nazi driving his car into a crowd of people, murdering one woman, injuring a great many others, on its face appears to be domestic terrorism. So I’m glad that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is stepping forward and treating it with the seriousness it deserves.   When it comes to what happened in Charlottesville that breaks all our hearts. You turn it on and it just – we shouldn’t be seeing this in America. Listen, Nazis and the Klan and white supremacists, these guys are racist, bigoted thugs. They’re idiots. What they’re saying is wrong, they are lies. And under the First Amendment they have a right to speak, even those profoundly wrong have a right to speak and express their views, but they’ve got to express it peaceably. They don’t have a right to violence, they don’t have a right to murder, they don’t have a right to assault others, but if you have Nazis and the Klan speaking, I think the rest of us have a moral obligation to denounce the lies and bigotry and evil and hatred that they’re spreading.  http://bit.ly/2wNhqW5"

6681,CongressmanKevinCramer,Republican,"Glad to see my bill pass the House today unanimously.   The National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act of 2017 creates a privately funded pilot program to conduct limited and selective vegetation management near utility infrastructure outside of a right-of-way.   A reliable supply of electricity is important on many levels, from human health and safety to commercial productivity. Yet, deep within forests managed by federal agencies the risk for outages has been elevated with declining forest health and increased forest fires. Utility companies want to keep the electrons flowing, but a high liability standard keeps them from vegetation management beyond their right-of-way. My bill creates a pilot program completely funded by participating utility companies under a reduced liability standard near their right-of-way so companies will go in to reduce potential hazards to disrupt reliable service."

6683,SenatorWhitehouse,Democrat,"I cannot support Betsy DeVos's nomination.   Every Rhode Island student deserves the chance to learn and gain the skills they need to get ahead. The mission of the U.S. Department of Education is to give them that chance. Promoting quality education for children no matter where they live requires a firm grasp of education policy and experience confronting complex issues. It requires an understanding that programs like Pell Grants, established by Rhode Island’s legendary Senator Claiborne Pell, often make higher education possible for aspiring college students. The Secretary of Education needs to understand what the Department can do to help make schools safe for all kids and how vital federal laws support children with special needs. Our Education Secretary must have this baseline knowledge and background. Mrs. DeVos’s record and testimony before the Committee show that she does not.     Moreover, the brand of ideologically driven education reform Mrs. DeVos has championed is not what Rhode Islanders want. I have received thousands of letters, calls, and emails in opposition to her nomination, many of them citing the school voucher and privatization agenda Mrs. DeVos and her allies imposed in Michigan. Rhode Island parents, teachers, and students have seen the poor results of that agenda and do not want it in our schools.     I am also deeply concerned with this nominee’s potential conflicts of interest and lack of transparency. Mrs. DeVos has failed to address these issues, despite numerous requests for information from me and other members of the Committee. We still do not know the extent of her ties to shadowy organizations designed to shield special interests from public scrutiny or whether she has disentangled herself fully from knotty investments. She needed to put these concerns to rest with thorough disclosures to us, but she hasn’t come close.   This is why Mrs. DeVos is wholly unqualified for this role and I cannot support her nomination."

It is also clear that every Member, Democrats and Republicans, deeply care about cybersecurity and privacy. It is critical we get this right, and I want to thank Chairman Bob Latta, as well as Ranking Members Jan Schakowsky and Frank Pallone Jr. for their hard work on this bipartisan legislation.   Automated vehicles are going to be developed – the only question is where it will happen first. We want the United States to remain in the driver’s seat, and today’s draft bill is a major step in the right direction.

Lastly, the amendment includes an $850 million MSI Innovation fund, to provide sustained funding on these campuses to drive innovative approaches to improving college completion, STEM degree attainment, and connection to the private sector.  “Minority serving institutions are routinely forced to do more with less. The PROSPER Act presents an opportunity to remedy that by fully and equitably funding these institutions but unfortunately, this bill does nothing to create opportunities for students at MSIs or HBCUs to prosper. Instead, it denies resources to the neediest schools based on a flawed metric,” said Congresswoman Adams. “MSIs serve a unique student population comprised of minority, non-traditional, and first generation college students. Instead of stripping them of much-needed resources, we should be investing in the students they serve to give them the best chance possible to complete their education.”    http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article189427944.html"

6746,CongressmanJimHimes,Democrat,"During the course of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in our electoral process and possible links and ties between the Russians and the Trump Administration and campaign, the existence of a concurrent FBI investigation brought manpower and resources to bear on a much larger scale. It was therefore and enormous setback when President Trump fired Director Comey in order to stymy that investigation.  The announcement that former FBI Director Robert Mueller will be appointed as special counsel to oversee the investigation in the Justice Department was very welcome news. Director Mueller brings with him two vital factors: a reputation as a man of the highest integrity, honesty and fairness and the widespread respect of the entire FBI.  I am optimistic that under this new leadership the FBI will be able to carry on with its vital work."

6750,RepMarkDeSaulnier,Democrat,"The Republicans’ tax plan will inflict financial pain on hardworking families nationwide. Intentionally short on details, this ""plan"" raises the lowest tax bracket by 20% in order to help pay for a 10% cut for the wealthiest Americans. It also effectively ends home ownership deductions -- keeping more people from the dream of owning a home. Americans want and deserve tax reform, but it should focus on the middle class; encourage home ownership, affordability, and opportunity; and not value the wealthiest 1% over all others."
6751,RepLaMalfa,Republican,"Today I joined the Mountain Counties Water Association to discuss water infrastructure projects in the North State, such as Governor Brown's ill-fated Delta Tunnels project and the need for Sites Reservoir, as well as better forest management to keep more water in the system."
6752,repyvettedclarke,Democrat,We have to keep the key stakeholders in #netneutrality first in our minds. Those stakeholders are the American People.
